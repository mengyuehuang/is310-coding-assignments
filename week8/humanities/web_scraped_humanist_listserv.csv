Welcome to HUMANIST
 
HUMANIST is a Bitnet/NetNorth electronic mail network for people
who support computing in the humanities. Those who teach, review
software, answer questions, give advice, program, write
documentation, or otherwise support research and teaching in this
area are included. Although HUMANIST is intended to help these
people exchange all kinds of information, it is primarily meant
for discussion rather than publication or advertisement.
 
In general, members of the network are encouraged to ask
questions and offer answers, to begin and contribute to
discussions, to suggest problems for research, and so forth. One
of the specific motivations for establishing HUMANIST was to
allow people involved in this area to form a common idea of the
nature of their work, its requirements, and its standards.
Institutional recognition is not infrequently inadequate, at
least partly because computing in the humanities is an emerging
and highly cross-disciplinary field. Its support is significantly
different from the support of other kinds of computing, with
which it may be confused. Perhaps you don't think so. In any
case, let us know what you do think, about this or any other
relevant subject.
 
HUMANIST is one of the inaugural projects of a new special
interest group for the support of computing in the humanities,
which is currently applying for joint affiliation with the
Association for Computing in the Humanities (ACH) and the
Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC).
Information about this SIG may be obtained by sending a message
to George Brett (ECSGHB@TUCC.BITNET).
 
Currently anyone given access to HUMANIST can send mail to all
other members of the network without restriction. It is expected
that the members will at least be civil to each other, however
spirited the argument!
 
New members are welcome, provided that they fit the broad
guidelines described above. Please tell anyone who might be
interested to send a note to me, giving his or her name, address,
telephone number, university affiliation, and a short description
of what he or she does to support computing in the humanities. I
will then add that person to the list. If anyone should wish to
be dropped from the list, please send a note to that effect.

For those of you who happen to know less than I do about the Bitnet
facility that runs HUMANIST, I have just sent out a lengthy memo by Eric
Thomas on the ""revised List Processor,"" or ListServ. The memo lists
commands available to you. Please note the section entitled, ""How can I
send commands to LISTSERV?"" If you're as ignorant about these things as
I was a few days ago, you'll need the help of some local expert.
HUMANIST has, I'm happy to say, reached addresses on ARPA-net, uucp, and
JANET (in the UK). It remains to be seen whether messages sent to
HUMANIST from these networks will be successfully redistributed. I'll be
asking one person from each to send a test message. This will mean,
alas, more junk-mail, which I hope you will excuse.

Hello:
 
I've just sent a complimentary copy of the Columbia University
""Scholarly Information Center Journal"" to all of you whose names I
had from the original meeting of the Ad Hoc SIC for Support Issues
at USC in April.   The SIC journal is published quarterly by the
Columbia University Libraries and the Center for  Computing
Activities and features articles aimed at informing the scholarly
community of available information resources and current trends
in information technology.  We are particularly trying to slant
this towards the humanists, not the EE and CS people.
 
If your name has been added to this mailing list since and you
would like a complimentary copy of this journal send me mail,
either here or to sue@cunixc.columbia.edu (for you unix buffs).
 
The editor, Bea Hamblett has just pointed out to me that, although
subscriptions are free to the Columbia community, there is a $10
subscription fee for others.  The issue I sent you neglects to
include this informaiton.  If you would like to subscribe, send
your money, name and address to:

an idea of something you would like to contribute, send mail
with your proposal (not the full article) to Bea at

The recent flood of junk mail you have received was due to what is
called a ""mailer loop,"" which is something like an echo that continually
increases in volume. This loop began when a message was sent by HUMANIST
to Joel Goldfield using a bad address (mea cupla!) and incorrectly
returned by network software to HUMANIST, which then dutifully sent it
out as a regular message to all members of the list, including Joel at
his bad address.... Fortunately for us all, the alert network wizards at
our Computing Services pounced on the echo and silenced it.
These things happen, I'm told. My apologies.
Next week I will be sending out information on the ListServ mailer that
should allow you to do various things with it. As for now, you can enter
the fray simply by sending a note to HUMANIST at UTORONTO.BITNET.

So, for example, if you're at Rochester, you don't want to ask UTORONTO's
listserv to send information, since SUVM is much closer.
So, you will likely want to ask your local expert to help you identify
the nearest node, if it's not obvious from the above list (which is
incomplete), and to figure out what commands are necessary in your
system, for example, to get a copy of LISTSERV MEMO, which describes
ListServ and its commands, and to get an up-to-date listing of the
members of HUMANIST -- which is growing every day.

Bill Winder wants to compile Gnu C++ on a PC under a *NIX* OS. He could,
in theory. The Gnu C++ configuration files do have the details for
compiling on a 386 platform, and of course all Gnu stuff compiles well
on the Sun 386i machine. But I suspect a 8086 or 80286 machine might present
problems.

Gnu C could be adapted for any machine code set in theory. It really depends
on how much time you have, and how well you understand your chip.

Although all of us here are engaged in the humanities, we are
hardly a monolithic group.
Some are linguists, some biblical scholars, some literary critics,
historians, etc.  Within our unity there is a tremendous variety.
And yet we still communicate fairly effectively.

Occasionally, though, I notice letters which employ terminology that
applies to a very specific humanistic discipline.  Generally that
discipline has something to do with literature.  I have speculated
often on why posters might write in this manner.  Are they addressing
people in their own field (effectively excluding the rest of us)?
Or are they trying to display their command of certain terms and con-
cepts?  Perhaps they are simply forgetting that not all of us have
the same extensive literary background.

Every one of us here could launch into jargon if he or she so desired.
Most don't.  I believe that this is because our goal here is to unite
people of diverse backgrounds.  In general, the effort here has been
to share knowledge rather than display it.  Surely a term here and
there might be employed out of pure laziness or oversight.  I have to
wonder, though, whether postings filled with literary conceits and allusions
really serve the common good.

 I was very interested in the description of IZE that someone mentioned a while
 back; I sent for a demonstration copy, and it strengthened my interest. I am
 thinking of using it to manage a very large collection of Wordperfect files
 which are frequently revised. The context is a large edition (letters of
 Disraeli); I hope eventually to find a management program that will work with
 files that begin as mere entries identifying documents (Disraeli's letters)
 before they are even transcribed, but which then develop as the editorial work
 on the letters proceeds. The files eventually become the camera-ready copy
 that is sent to the press. What appeals to me about IZE is that it does not
 require the material to be formatted or re-entered according to its needs, and
 its flexibility does not require one to anticipate all the uses that will be
 made of the textual database that is developed. Are there people who have any
 knowledge of IZE that might be relevant to my interest? I would be very happy
 to hear from them, or from people who have found other systems that I should
 be looking at. M.G. Wiebe, Queen's University, Kingston, Canada K7L 3N6

I am looking into automatic phonetic transcription of nineteenth century
French poetry for a literary project.  My starting point is the work
done by Pratt and Silva, ""PHONTRNS"", CHum 1969; and more recently
Nina Catach, La phonetisation automatique du francais, CNRS 1984.
Can anyone help me out with suggestions or information about...
- Similar projects on progress
- Other programs in use or under development
- Transcription programs modified to transcribe French poetry
- An E-Mail address for Nina Catach
- Sources for French poetry in machine readable form  and
-   making our machine readable texts available to others

I strongly believe that the mind functions best when it works in
symbol systems which it is udes to.  To this end I have insisted on
CRT display of the International Phonetic Alphabet in my own programs.
Does anyone work with commercial software which permits such a modified
character set on PC-DOS machines using Herc+, EGA or VGA cards?  I am
thinking of a kind of TSR program which would allow any other software
to have two keybords, display an altered character set, and print this
changed character set.  A program called ""Turbofonts"" does the basic job
but the version I have used is very awkward.

I would like to take this opportunity to express the delight I always
seem to feel after editing a new batch of biographies. It is, of course,
a relief to finish an overdue task (this time there are 28 of them!),
but the largely clerical labour involved is made very light indeed by
the infectious energy and enthusiasm most of the biographies express.

I find the community of computing humanists to be especially interesting
and congenial in comparison to other academic groupings I know. Perhaps
this is because so little status is to be obtained among the mighty for
being involved with computing, perhaps also because computing in the
humanities naturally tends to attract a radically interdisciplinary
group of practitioners. Then, too, computing is fun.

Whatever the causes, the effect continues to be full of sap, though the
wintry chill of unavoidable work periodically leads to spare silences.

Humanist was created on this day in May 1987. In our Epimethean way of
reckoning, that makes Humanist 2 years old, but the volume number is
Promethean, and so says 3. I remember both my (human) children emerging
from their terrible twos, but I also remember having some difficulty
seeing how the turn of their personal calendars made any difference in
their temperament. I think sometime in her third year my daughter, whom
a mentor of mine had named Kuan Yin in honour of her remarkable serenity
and radiant love for all the world, had to be renamed Boom Boom because
she suddenly became the being she has been ever since. (She's now 15!)
My son, somewhat younger, had no sudden change.

Perhaps these anecdotes (upon which I could proudly enlarge, have no
doubt) are just as good as to describe the horoscope, haruspicate or
scry, observe disease in signatures, evoke biography from the wrinkles
of the palm and tragedy from fingers; release omens by sortilege, or tea
leaves, riddle the inevitable with playing cards, fiddle with pentagrams
or barbituric acids, or dissect the recurrent image into pre-conscious
terrors -- to explore the womb, or tomb, or dreams.... In any case,
birthdays, like new years and hallowe'ens, are times when all sorts of
strangeness is permitted and larger visions demanded. I am storing up my
observations about Humanist for a paper at the MLA next December, so I
will let everyone enjoy his or her own reflections about Humanist as it

There is in the public domain a font-printer/formatter for Epson printers
called BRADFORD which I know has both Greek and Hebrew fonts. I have used
neither. You can pick up the program and the fonts from any bulletin board.
I know there is a CP/M version, and there has to be a DOS version too. The
program is shareware, so there won't be source code available. But the whole
deal costs maybe $10. There is another NLQ font package for Epson printers
in the public domain called EPSET. I know very little about it.

For the DEC LA50 and compatibles there is a font-editor and formatter in
the public domain. The editor is called FEDIT, and although I don't think
the author, Chris Hall, has written Greek or Hebrew fonts, they would be
trivial to create using FEDIT. FPRINT, the font printer and formatter which
goes with FEDIT is excellent, and I use it for everything. Mr. Hall has
written some 25 or 30 fonts for it, mostly similar to Mac fonts. The source
code (in Aztec C) is in the public domain, and can be easily modified for
other printers. (This would probably only involve entering the codes for
setting your printer into graphics mode and for firing the individual print
elements in the printer head.) I use the CP/M version. Obviously since
the source code is available versions for DOS or any other operating system
for which a C compiler is available would be easy to make.

                           ONLINE NOTES
                          FEBRUARY, 1989

   I regret that the Online Notes this semester has not been sent

   In the coming weeks, I will be distributing the already written
   notes for March, April and May.  Please accept my apologies.

APPLE AND HP PERIPHERALS

   A weakiness of the Apple Macintosh from a bias perspective is
   printing.  True, the Apple LaserWriter is an excellent 300 dpi.
   printer, but it's too costly even for a University when you
   consider that this printer can only functionally serve perhaps
   seven users at any one time without becoming overloaded with
   work to do.  The IMAGEWRITER LQ does not produce good quality
   printing for the price of $1,000 for a single user. The
   standard IMAGEWRITE was o.k. four years ago, but not today.  It
   makes YOU look bad on the page.

   Well, we have been investigating alternatives to this situation
   starting with Hewlett-Packard, a company which produce two good
   and less costly printers, the HPLaserJet Series II and DeskJet.

   DESKJET: In a recent Penn Printout from the University of
   Pennsylvania Computer Resource Center, Jeff Seaman, our local Tsar of
   microcomputer at Penn, praised the DESKJET as a good machine for
   the price.  He feels, and I agree, that this printer threatens the
   hold of dot-matrix printers for most users.  The DESKJET produces
   good quality printing (300 dpi) when hooked up to a DOS-based
   machine ($440. retail).  The only disadvantage, I see, to the
   DeskJet is that the ink runs if wet.

   Jeff's article went on to caution against hooking a DESKJET to an
   APPLE MACINTOSH which if it worked well would be a really solid
   idea.  The problem is that it works, albeit slowly according to HP
   (hotline No. 208-323-2551).  Two companies produce a software and
   hardware link with the DESKJET.  These links make the DESKJET
   appear to be an IMAGEWRITER LQ.  The problem is the speed of
   printing: 5-10 minutes per page according to HP, or it is 3
   minutes per page according to the Third Party vendors.  The Third
   Party Vendors are: Orange Micro Company (800-223-8029) and
   Phoenix Technology (800-367-5600).  Their software/hardware
   ""solution"" costs about $150.  By the way, they make available a
   print spooler for ""deep, deep background printing.""  I think
   they should at that speed, don't you?  Well, it really isn't
   their fault though.  HP should be blamed for their independent
   format!  HP makes good and reliable printers which are
   generally incompatible for market reasons.

   The Computer Resource Center and SAS Computer Services tested
   WORK-AND-PRINT from Insight Development Corporation.  The
   DESKJET's speed was just slower than the IMAGEWRITER, and
   certainly a lot quieter.  It printed about a page every 40
   seconds at about 120 cps of Courier typeface. Speed of printing
   dropped considerably if one chose to print unsupported fonts.
   The speed then was on the order of 8 cps. The quality was
   exceptionally good, but did smudge if wetted.  The printer
   itself was silent.

   A new version of the DESKJET, the DESKJET PLUS, will increase the
   speed of printing mostly by improving the paper feed.  In
   addition, this new version will support a wider variety of
   enhancement features (in particular, italics) than the current
   model.  Supposedly the cost of the newer DESKJET PLUS will be
   identical with the older DESKJET, about $440.

   By the way, HP heard indirectly what we were up to here, and
   let us know that they plan to release a version of the DESKJET
   THAT RUNS EXCLUSIVELY ON THE MACINTOSH.  The official announcement
   is planned for July, 1989.

   LASERJET :  HP has tested hooking an HPLaserJet Series II to a
   Macintosh, and unlike the DESKJET they report that it does work
   for an individual machines.  The HP hotline Rep. had no idea
   if it would work on the AppleTalk network.

   Three vendors can provide the necessary hardware cable and
   software:

       Insight Develop Corp (415-376-9500)
       Orange Micro Company (800-223-8029)
       Soft Style Inc       (808 396-6368)

   The Computer Resource Center and SAS Computer Services tested the
   HPLaserJet with Work-and-Print.  The LaserJet printed slowly off
   of a MAC PLUS Printer.  Though we would expect better performance
   on a MAC SE/30 or MAC II (perhaps 40 percent), the HPLaserJet tied
   to a MAC is too slow to function as a network printer, let alone a
   printer for an individual user.  It took a minute to print each
   page of a ten page document.  Printing was just a little slower if
   the LaserJet had to shift into a fully graphics mode.  We have
   investigated the other listed products though not tested them.
   The Grappler from Orange Micro Company cannot function on the
   AppleTalk network, and printing speed is three minutes per page.
   Other than that, it works according to the Sales Representation.
   Oh well, I guess, the LaserWriter remains the machine of choice
   for network users.

Since Mary Dee was bold to reveal herself by telling tales of a computer
I also remember working with -- in fact [name-drop warning!] I toggled
switches on an IBM 709 (with its 6000 vacuum tubes) in my youth -- I'll
also uncover.  I was once asked by a friend what sex I thought the
computer had.  Wanting to provoke her, I remarked that it was obviously
female: bitchy, powerful, and mysterious.  She said, ""No, no, it's
obviously male -- handy to have around the house, but when I don't need
it I can turn it off and walk away.""

I'm fascinated by the number of people who think of the machine as
neuter.  There's almost nothing I regard as neuter.  According to
Chinese tradition, if I'm not badly mistaken, everything can be sorted
into male and female.  And what do we mean by neuter?  Sexually
unremarkable, which could suggest the same sex as the beholder?

X-Humanist: Vol. 4 Num. 2 (3)


I believe it was I who enlarged the tidy question of the gender of words
meaning ""computer"" in languages other than English.  My (unexpressed)
premise was recently stated by Willard McCarty: the way we talk about
computers can ""tell us a considerable amount about ourselves.""

It appears that the systems programmer I know may be using the masculine
pronoun for a program (the VM/CMS operating system) rather than for the
hardware (""he is thinking about crashing"").  The comment is usually not
about something good.  The only times I have heard feminine references
were in speeches of encouragement (""You can do it, girl!"") or praise
(""She found the file in the root directory!"").

I am interested in the pronoun number used for a computer.  ""The""
computer may be used of a mainframe rather than for ""a"" microcomputer,
but it does not seem that simple.  I used to think that those who were
sophisticated about computing, and who recognized that there were
significant differences among computers talked of ""a"" computer or of
""computers,"" and that those who failed to understand the differences
talked of ""the"" computer.  It now appears to me that some very
sophisticated computer users speak of ""the"" computer when they mean any
computer: a micro, mini, or mainframe.

Another matter (that may ""tell us a considerable amount about
ourselves"") is that we talk about computers in a highly metaphoric way;
technical and non-technical language about computers is filled with
figures of speech of all kinds: files (a metaphor to start with) are
packed, squeezed, crunched, and squashed; they can be killed, or they
may hang or crash the system and force us to boot or reboot.

I notice that my students ""boot"" a computer to start it (the original
metaphor seems to be that the operating system pulls itself up by its
own boot straps), but they also ""boot"" a computer by kicking out the
operating system (rebooting it).

Do HUMANISTs have observations about the metaphoric language of
computing?

This query represents somewhat of a digression from the ongoing talk
about the sex of computers and the number (singular or plural), but it
is the same kind of question.

When listening to others talk about the behaviour of computers I have
often noticed what seemed to be an unusually high percentage of
superstitious expressions.  Sheizaf Rafaeli, as I recall, refers in an
article to our habit of speaking in animistic terms about the machine,
but I wonder if anyone has studied contemporary linguistic usage and
found that superstition was unusually prevalent amongst systems
programmers and other experts who deal with very complex computing

X-Humanist: Vol. 4 Num. 4 (5)


Mary Dee Harris's posting about not remembering `ever thinking of the
machine as anything but a machine -- without gender' invokes memories.
At the time of which she speaks--or maybe a little later, the IBM/360
had just come out--I was not working with assembly language.  I was a
lawyer working on Wall Street, for the most part assembling contracts,
leases, and other legal instruments (instruments that to a surprising
extent were composed of `so long as ...', `if ... then ... ', `else
...', `while ...', and similar control structures).

And then we became peripherally involved with the case of a corporation
that had acquired a computer and--as a consequence--ended up with a
mismatch between billings and receivables of fifty million dollars, back
in those innocent days when that was a lot of money.  The corporation
wrote off five million dollars for its losses from this matter and went
out and purchased a lot of quill pens, while at my office several of us
decided that it was time that we learned something about computers.

Being a very establishment sort of firm, we were able to pull a few
strings and infiltrate ourselves into the IBM Executive Computer
Concepts Course--a peculiar cross between a boondoggle and a bootcamp
for financial vice-presidents and comptrollers of Fortune 500 companies
that were considering the initial purchase of a computer.  The course
was taught with a simulated time machine: on the first day the computer
had just been invented and the only way to program was machine language;
the next day assembler was invented; the day following came Fortran; the
day following that introduced Cobol, and so-on to APL ... that was on
the day they were going to demonstrate the C(athode) R(ay) T(ube), only
it was broken.

And so, for me too, the first introduction to computers was to registers
and to `the Chinamen inside the computer with abacuses that really made
it work.'

And then years later, when I was trying to write a filter that would
insert double underlining into a Wordstar file, I learned BASIC, which
didn't work because it would not treat a carriage return as an ASCII
character, and PASCALZ, which worked but excruciatingly slowly and
required that I like to the machine by telling it that ASCII characters
were simply bytes, and finally assembly language, which not only worked
but also gave up the pretense that there was no such thing as a register
inside the machine.

And now whenever I work with a computer I sense the data being moved on
conveyor belts through the machine, looping around, like marbles in a
pinball machine: tahpucka, tahpucka, ..., tahpucka.

The computer is not alive, it does not have gender, it does not
have--except most periphally--a G(raphical) U(ser) I(nterface).  It is
an abacus, disguised is a great, big Rube Goldberg contraption.

X-Humanist: Vol. 4 Num. 5 (6)


I was grateful for Willard's contribution on the sex of computers.  We
are in danger of making some fundamental linguistic muddles which in my
own field (not generally at the forefront of linguistics) were exposed
and attacked as long ago as 1961 by James Barr, *The Semantics of
Biblical Language*.  Only in a language like English where all nouns
are neuter unless explicitly male or female could the use of the
pronoun be at all significant.  If 'computer' in Dutch is a masculine
noun of course it will be 'hij', just as 'teknon' (child) in greek is
'auto' (neuter) not 'autos'.  But to translate these into English as
'he' (for the computer) or 'it' (for the child) would simply display
ignorance of the workings of language.  dare I say that parts of this
discussion have come perilously close to displays of such ignorance?

I liked Willard's analysis of 'metaphorical sex' but feel it's
potentially simplistic.  Is a car in English 'she' because it is
temperamental, or 'she' because it is a symbol of masculinity or 'she'
because (like a woman) it gives one a special sort of thrill?  Or do
males generally personalise things as female, because another male
would be a potential rival?  One would need to know a great deal more
about the sex-stereotyping which influenced the original choice, as
well as that (potentially very different!) of the other users of the
terminology.

The tools David Stuehler asks for are, in all essentials, already available in
Nota Bene.  NB's textbase component (which no other wordprocessor has, to my
knowledge) allows one to take notes, search them via Boolean logic for
keywords, and integrate the results in various ways into one's text without
leaving the wordprocessor.  The bibliographical supplement, Ibid, allows one to
enter each item one time into a master bibiographical database and then, via
various kinds of searching (e.g. by keyword, by publication date, by author, by
subject, by publisher) construct any kind of subset desired.  These can then be
formatted in MLA style, APA style, Chicago A or B style, etc.  New versions of
NB itself, the textbase, and Ibid are about to be released.  The new Ibid, for
example, will allow easy conversion of bibiographical data into footnotes and
vice versa.  The program will come with add-on utilities that convert between
NB files and those of other popular programs like MS Word, WordPerfect.  There
will also be optional spell-checkers available for several European languages.
The special ""Lingua"" version of NB will handle Cyrillic, Hebrew, Greek, etc.

An Automatic Parser for New Testament Greek

Generalised Phrase Structure Grammar(GPSG) is a way of analysing
natural language in terms of feature-value pairs.  Six years ago a
partial GPSG analysis of classical Greek was written as a PhD thesis by
Ronnie Cann. I attempted to implement this analysis on a sun3 using the
Grammar Development Environment(GDE), a Lisp tool developed by the
Alvey project.

AIM: The original motivation came from  the New Testament
Department at Edinburgh University, who suggested an
automatic parser for teaching purposes. The emphasis of the project was
on syntactic analysis.

The Fribergs' tagged text was used to provide morphological information
about each word.

RESULT: Given a sentence of NT Greek a parse tree is produced showing
the structure of the sentence ie what is the direct or indirect object
of the verb, which adjective agrees with which noun etc.

The work was done as a 5-month MSc project and so is incomplete. Only
basic grammatical constructions can be coped with and the display needs
improving to be comprehensible to any but linguists.

in programming for the humanities offered by Dakota State
University via BITNET this summer.  If you are interested in
enrolling, please respond with a brief message sent to me as
ERIC@SDNET.BITNET, and I will send you an electronic registration
form.

   CHUM 650 COMPUTER PROGRAMMING FOR THE HUMANITIES.  An
introduction to programming using SNOBOL4 for applications in
the humanities such as analysis of texts, arranging data from
research, and formatting for printing and desktop publishing.
Prerequisites: a baccalaureate degree in the humanities or a
baccalaureate degree in another field and a minimum of 24
semester hours course work in the humanities, access to and
familiarity with BITNET, and an understanding of MS-DOS commands.
Three semester hours credit.  The course will start approximately
June 1, and it will end approximately August 1.

   The total cost of the course is $228.45.  No textbook is
required.  Students will be sent a disk containing a public-
domain SNOBOL4 compiler and a text editor.

   Students may audit the course or enroll for credit and receive
a grade of Pass or Fail.  The cost to audit the course is the
same as enrolling for credit.

   The course will teach academic humanists to write useful
computer programs to produce word frequency listings,
concordances, and indexes.  The language of choice for this
course is SNOBOL4 because it is a powerful language designed for
non-numeric computing; humanists can write useful programs in
SNOBOL4 almost from the start.  The course will begin with an
introduction to programming, then cover techniques of structuring
SNOBOL4 programs, and it will finish with students completing
individual projects of their own creation.

   The programming assignments will be designed for MS-DOS
microcomputers.  Although most assignments can be modified for
Macintosh users, the Mac users would have to purchase MaxSPITBOL,
and they would need some understanding of Macintosh file
structure.

   Students must have the ability to upload and download programs
from the mainframe that runs BITNET mail to the microcomputer
used for the programming assignments.

be given for traditional ""copyright"" of these same electronic academic

received proper recognition and respect for an intellectual contribution: both
can be accomplished just as easily through 'copyleft.'  Copyright is used to
ensure that one party does not appropriate intellectual property of another,
establish ownership and then commercially benefit from the sale and
distribution: 'copyleft' will work just as well.  Copyright may be useful, we

Humanist had a very quiet birthday earlier this week.  It's become
somewhat of a tradition for us to note each year's passing, and I
have spent much of the last week wondering exactly what it was I
wanted to say about Humanist (the list) and Humanists (readers and
writers both) this year.  (Allen gets to make his own statement, if
he likes.)

Electronic lists have come a long way since 7 May 1987, and the number
of different lists seems to have expanded close to exponentially every
time I pause to review them.  And I wonder, sometimes, exactly what
Humanist's role ought to be becoming now, as the roster of more
specialized discussion groups grows longer and longer, and as cross-
posting notices becomes something more than epidemic on those various
lists.

Humanist has never been ""just another list,"" but it seems to have lost
some of the spirit and vitality that it once had.  We're all busy, we
all have more electronic mail and information to process, and how
we're dealing with issues surrounding humanities computing has changed.

And at the same time, I'm still hungry to know what it is others
who ""do"" humanities computing are doing, I'm curious as to what
sorts of things those who ask for e-texts of various genres want to
be able to do with them, what conclusions those who attend various
conferences dealing with electronic tools and humanities issues
are coming to, what Humanist readers want to be doing with the
gigabytes of information that pass through their terminals.
I'm curious about how people are (or are they?) trying to work
out the kinks in collaborative work that computers and networks
can make possible, and what new tools people wish they had.  Those
are all topics I'd like to see discussed more on Humanist.

As an editor of Humanist, I'll admit that I wish I had the time to
compile a FAQ (Frequently Asked Question) list that gave definitive
answers on fonts, for example, so that when the questions get asked
every month or so, we wouldn't have the same discussion over and
over again.

This, then, is my request to those of you who have read this far:
that you focus on the questions of what humanities computing is
and isn't, that you share the information and the queries various
conferences raise about using computers in humanities disciplines,
that where you have the time and the will, you talk about the
hows and whys and wherefores, for example, of electronic texts,
rather than simply searching for their existence.

I feel honored to have met as many Humanist readers as I have,
and I treasure many memories of conversations both live and
electronic;  I wish that it were possible to bring some of the
vitality and intensity of those conversations with you back to
the net as well.

I know this has been discussed before, but as usual, one doesn't remember
these discussions at the time...8-)

are there expert (or other) opinions on the legality/ethicality of scanning
a text which is apparently in copyright, but which is out of print, and for
which a good faith effort to contact the current holder of the copyright
has been unsuccessfully made, for the purposes of searching and reference
on-line for a single small undergraduate class?

???

Greetings, fellow Humanists.  I am looking for freeform text retrieval
software for the Mac.  I would like to be able to search through a set
of Microsoft Word files (or some other format; if absolutely
necessary, text-only files) and retrieve either all documents or all
paragraphs containing a specified search pattern.  The search
instructions would need to include Boolean operators.

The purpose of this system would be to give me access to notes on
sources without much thought about organization and keywords at the
notetaking stage.  If anyone has suggestions for another way to
approach the problem, please let me know.  I would like to keep all my
notes on one source together but access notes by subject while writing
papers or trying to remember where I read something (which occurs more
and more frequently, unfortunately).

The only product I've heard of which does this kind of search is
Sonar; I'd appreciate it if Sonar users could let me know how well it
works.

A quick note in reply to Ray Simons earlier mention of the incomplete nature of
the electronic version of the Faeire Queen held by the Oxford Text Archive.
Like Ray we went back to the orginal depositor and received a new version of
the text, greatly improved and marked-up. We have also recently received an
SGML styled tagged version of it!

If anyone else who has used our texts and has found errors which they have

The MLA Bibliography on OCLC will include all data from 1963 to the
present.  Retrospective data (1963-1980) is currently undergoing
reprocessing and restructuring so that index terms from earlier years will
more closely match current indexing terminology.  We hope to have the

Subject: Gopher Intertextuality
Date: Sat, 8 May 93 07:07:31 PDT
X-Humanist: Vol. 7 Num. 1 (1)



This is in response to the recent debate about the reliability of
texts on gopher because of the multiplication of texts.  Recently
Donald Spaeth made a good point about the reader's perspective of
the whole issue when he said that responsible scholars prefer
authoritative editions.  Kyle Barger and C. M. Sperberg-McQueen
both responded to this point by claiming that it is not the
gopher systems which are at fault in these matters, and besides,
there are numerous text versions of say Shakespeare and the bible.

My response to this as a literary scholar is that there came a
point when the prolification of unauthorized and often blatantly
mutated versions of texts made scholarship difficult and unap-
petizing.  The institutional response to this was to work out
standardized methods for building an authoritative text.  Good
scholars go to those volumes to do their work.

The problem with gopher texts is that they are somewhat ephemeral
and they don't always come tagged with the year of ""publication""
(I suppose in cyberspace it might be better to have the day of
publication.  Since there is an uncertainty as to which text came
first in this schema, it seems like a good idea to start making
some rules about how to identify texts in the first place.

At any rate, there's no reason whatsoever why we should repeat
the mistake we made with published (on paper) works.  That is,
we need not wait until scholarship becomes difficult and unap-
petizing before we act.  Why not institute some sort of control
now instead of waiting until this problem becomes so big, we must
solve it or perish in the attempt.

X-Humanist: Vol. 7 Num. 2 (2)


The discussion of gopher and texts and copyright is an extremely important
one, whose complications and implications are likely to increase as the
number of users of e-texts increases and the number of available texts
grows and as the quality of tools like Veronica improves (Now that we have
archie and veronica, can jughead be far behind?).  The point that needs
emphasis, however, is that despite the obvious fact that we have many versions
of texts in the print environment too, we also have standards and mechanisms
for the evaluation of the authenticity of printed text.  We also have some
way of judging the quality of a given text based on who the publisher is.
Generally, we will have more confidence in a text reproduced by, let us say,
Cambridge University Press than one reproduced by Vanity Press, Inc.  On the
net, though, we lack this sign of quality and authenticity because everyone
can literally self-publish not only her or his own texts but those of others
as well.  We desperately need on the the net the value-added that publishers
provide in the print world.  Until we have that (as well as a fuller
elaboration of fair use in the electronic environment) it will be very
difficult for us to have the same confidence in material we get electronically
as we now do in material we acquire from reputable publishers of printed texts.

Re. Donald Spaeth's plea for ""pointers"" to the One Authorized Text
rather than multiple copies of it: the World Wide Web (WWW) aims
to provide at least a partial solution, being a hypertext system in
which each user is encouraged to create personal ""links"" to
documents of interest, wherever on the net they may be, rather
than copying them locally (its motto, as it were, is: don't *get*
it, get *to* it).  You need your own client software to do so;
but then you need a gopher client to do a lot of what gopher can
do, too. Most public-access WWW sites I've seen are pretty tepid:
they look just like gophers; but U. Kansas just came up with a
really cute application called Lynx, which is the first I've seen
that actually gets the ""look and feel"" of hypertext on a public-access
site. QUOTING FROM MEMORY!! - the site is ukanaix.ukans.edu, login
either lynx or www.  I don't think it'll let you create personal
links, though: for that it'd need a separate account for every
user (like the freenets have); but it's a nice demo. of WWW.
Of course that still begs the question of whether people will
be prepared to rely on the network for important documents.
The advantages are most obvious when the document is frequently
updated; it quickly gets to be a pain to keep track of such things
and re-copy them every 2 or 3 months; a customized menu set with
direct links to the updated copy is much better.

Kyle Barger and Michael Sperburg-McQueen both make the same point:
there's already a lot of variation about, and the scholar has to cope
with it.  I couldn't agree more.  This occurs in early modern historical
documents just as much published texts.  I spent yesterday evening reading
four witnesses' statements on the same event and trying to re-construct
what happen. There are four versions of the Compton religious census
for Wiltshire, and I can think of three scholars who have devoted considerable
time to comparing them.

I was making two points, one of degree and one of validation.
Electronic reproduction multiples the version problem many times.
Books and articles are published, and the process ensures that both
the publisher and the author/editor have an opportunity to check the text
before it is printed.  The fact that this process was not available in,
say, the 17th century when the King James Bible and Shakespeare plays were
produced isn't necessarily relevant since most of us use modern editions
which *do* rely on the process.  Electronic reproduction removes the publisher
and enables texts to be ""reprinted"" without reference to an author/editor.

In other words, I am not convinced that the analogy with Shakespeare
plays and the Bible is a good one.  Perhaps Kyle has the answer, though:
some servers will come to be recognised as reliable ""publishers"",
perhaps because they will only accept documents directly from their
authors.

Subject: TLS on information technology
Date: Sun, 9 May 93 12:38:33 EDT
X-Humanist: Vol. 7 Num. 2 (5)


The Times Literary Supplement for 30 April 1993 (no. 4700) is a
special issue on information technology, with articles on virtual
reality, hypertext (unfavourably reviewing David Jay Bolter's
_Writing Space_), cyberpunkery and techno-futurism of the wilder
sort, CD-ROM textual collections and reference works, and
finally, an article by Hugh Kenner, ""The scholar's friend: The
irresistible rise of the word processor"".  There's considerable
matter for discussion in this TLS, but I would like to draw
attention only to Kenner's article, in which he raises some
matters particularly relevant to Humanist and its relations.

The first half of the article is devoted to the `irresistible
rise' of Kenner's subtitle, to the early history as he observed
it, including some telling anecdotes of resistance from the likes
of editors and publishers. The second half turns to the
computerisation of the humanities in our universities, beginning
with classics, David Packard's work, the Thesaurus Linguae
Graecae and its Classical Latin counterpart.  (Kenner appears not
to realise that the TLG and Latin corpora are available on CD-ROM,
which most of us now access via MS-DOS or Macintosh
machines. But this is a minor point.)  The most interesting part
of the article occurs at the end, where he discusses the crisis
in scholarly publishing and some electronic means of dealing with
it.

Why, Kenner asks, need we incur the rising costs of niche
journals when these could be published electronically?  There are
two points to be made here: first that this is already beginning
to happen, and second that mere imitation of print is not the
answer, or at least not a particularly good answer.  Note, in
particular, the Bryn Mawr Classical Review (BMCR) and recent
announcements on Humanist from the American Philological
Association, the journal Arethusa, and Johns Hopkins University
Press.  BMCR is my favourite example, not so much because it
publishes good reviews via e-mail, keeping networked classicists
up to date with work in their field free of charge.  Rather, it
and a few others are interesting from our perspective because
they use the medium to do something it is particularly suited
for.  Consider the role reviews, as distinct from articles and
books, play in research; wouldn't it be better on the whole to
have these things not merely delivered free very soon after they
are written, but more significantly, perhaps, in electronic form,
so that a collection of them can be searched for key terms?
Consider what kind of work the ability to search especially
favours, and what such work can do for fields characterised by
narrowly defined specialities.

It may be that the only way for many journals to survive will be
to publish electronically, although there are some very serious
social and technical problems to be solved before exclusive
e-publication can be a practical alternative.  I am bothered,
however, by the imitative approach, both because it lacks wit and
because it avoids the syste",Converted_Text,1993-1994,,,,

I don't have anything to say about nationalism per se, but the following
does relate to exploration, history, tourism, conservation, and national
""myth-making"" (at least in one sense of 'myth')...  I'm afraid my citations
will be vague.  This is an avocation for me, and I don't have the material
memorized (or present in my office).

Over the past fifteen or twenty years, American landscape photography has
seen a reaction against the kind of heroic myth making that is probably
best exemplified in the work of Ansel Adams.  Mark Klett and John Pfahl
are two (out of many) photographers who have participated.  Since the new
landscape photographers are self-consciously trying to remake their field,
their books and catalogs tend to contain essays, by the photographers or by
others, explaining what they take the issues to be and what they are
trying to do with their work.  They tend to have a strong awareness of the
history of their field, and they actively bring that awareness to bear on
their own work.  They are interested in how photography was used in the
exploration of the American West; in how it has been used to influence
political decisions, such as the decision to establish Yosemite National
Park; and in how it was used to create an image -- really, a kind of myth
-- of the West as a grand, uninhabited, spiritual place.  Their work tends
toward documenting change and the influence of people on the environment.
They try to question the extent to which the land can be understood
independently of the people who live, work, and play there.

If this sounds at all useful to you (and you don't already know about it),
a good place to start would be the issue of _Aperture_ entitled _Beyond
Wilderness_.  It came out in the late '80s or early '90s.  You might also
want to look at Klett's book _Revealing Territory_.  Both of these contain
useful bibliographies in addition to essays and (obviously) photographs.
If you're interested in the relation to the history of the West, look for
the book by the Rephotographic Survey Project, which Klett participated
in.  (I'm afraid I don't even remember the title.  It would be in both
Klett's book and _Beyond Wilderness_, though.)  An important early document
for this movement in landscape photography is the catalog for an exhibit
called (I think) _The New Topographics_.  The exhibit was at the
International Museum of Photography at the George Eastman House in
Rochester, N.Y.  That exhibit was not particularly concerned
with the West, its myths and its politics, though.

Again, sorry to be so vague about the citations.  If anybody needs better
ones, let me know and I'll look them up.  I hope that posting this proves
useful.  As I say, it's not what I work on, so I have no sense of how well
known this material is.

In response to the question about works on parks, I am currently writing
my dissertation on how the national parks have been promoted in the
19C-20C in the US.  My central argument is that the national parks have
become mythic nationalistic representations of how Americans perceive
themselves in the world, how they want others to see themselves.  I use
as evidence advertising imagery--photos, posters, paintings that have
been translated into promotional materials, souvenirs, and architecture
in the parks.  I am interested in learning how Finns view their own parks
and if there are parallels with the American experience.

     technology in the humanities.  The goals are to picture
     where the humanities and information technology will
     intersect in the coming years, and what the benefits and
     liabilities will be in such an intersection.

     Giovanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-1494) was one of the

     As a result of his innovative and creative explorations
     in thought, he fell afoul of the authorities of the day.
     He was known for his vivid imagination.

     PICO is a  simple  full screen ASCII editor for UNIX
     computer operating systems.  It is the editor used within
     the popular Pine Mailer, and is thus known to and used by
     thousands of people daily on the burgeoning information
     highway.

     Thus, the name PICO v.2 (or  Pico, version 2 ) is
     intended to suggest the need that scholars in the human
     sciences have to upgrade their own work in an
     information-based society, with new tools and new
     challenges to the old ways, even as computer tools are
     regularly upgraded and rethought in light of the input of
     those who use the systems.  This creative dynamic made
     the first Pico's Renaissance a true period of  rebirth .

WORLD WIDE WEB ANNOUNCEMENT

My Interpreting Ancient Manuscripts material -- formerly available in
HyperCard -- has been adapted and revised for the World Wide Web.  The URL
is:

http://www.stg.brown.edu/projects/mss/overview.html

I have tried to cover the basic, introductory material regarding
paleography and textual criticism with an example of the latter and a
simulated exercise in English.  I have attempted to make the web easy to
use by having hypertext links within text, multiple links at the bottom of
each page, as well as a complete index page.  In addition to my material
(with numerous excerpts from standard works on the subject) I have also
integrated links to other relevant WWW sites.

The goal is for students in Intro. to New Testament courses to be able to
get a feel for what is involved in getting from the ancient manuscripts to
the modern critical text.  This also is a good foundation for students to
continue study by reading the standard works of Metzger, Aland, Finegan,
etc. (citations are noted throughout the web).

I would also appreciate any information on how this material has been used
for classes.  I will be presenting a paper on the project at the
International Medieval Congress in July so I would appreciate evaluative
information.

This project has taken a lot of work -- my reward is your feedback.

I don't think this is by Horace, and the Latin goes ""materiAm superabat
opus"", which is usually taken to mean: ""The workmanship was better than the
material(s)"" or something like that.  Formerly, I was a good latinist; now I
must confess I can't place the author, though this is a familiar quotation.
   This is definitely not by Horace; I just looked into Lane Cooper and did
not find it there.

This is one scholars have argued about for years.  Plants which opened doors
and locks were well-known in folklore, e.g. springwort.  It may be that
sesame is just a magic word, it may be connected with sesame, which does
have magical properties, or it may it is just a reference to springwort.  If
you want to go further, Funk and Wagnalls' Standard Dictionary of Folklore,
Mythology and Legend (s.v. ""open sesame"") is a good place to start; or
Grimm's Germanische Mythologie.

Subject: Humanist begins its 10th year
Date: 
X-Humanist: Vol. 10 Num. 1 (1)



Birthdays and anniversaries seem like ""eternal returns"", ritual moments that
demand reflection on the simultaneous past and future. So I am righteous in
my excuse to belabour you with editorial ruminations at the end of
Humanist's ninth year and the beginning of its tenth.

Humanist began on 7 May 1987 as a consequence of an inspirational moment at
a conference of the Association for Computers and the Humanities in
Columbia, South Carolina. Its beginning was almost accidental, no more than
an attempt to provide continuing conversation for a small group of
frustrated individuals who met after hours at the conference to discuss the
lack of support for humanities computing and what might be done about it.
Philosophical investigations and meditations, as well as exchanges of
information, proved more appealing than academic politics, for which we may
all be most grateful. Thus the creature we now exercise. What a dismal thing
Humanist would have been otherwise!

Almost a decade later computing has become nearly universal, although in the
humanities its application remains at a primitive level on the whole and, as
Mark Olsen has famously pointed out, its effects on the disciplines are not
always obvious. It seems to me that John Burrows' counsel to patience, based
on the fact that change in scholarship is slow, is right, however. He and
many others have shown what can be done by what they have done, and if it
takes the rest of us longer, or if some of us choose non-computational
methods, so what? The proof is in the pudding, and I smell delicious
puddings in several corners of the house. Yes, I know, many are cruelly
excluded from the house altogether. How can we use computing to ameliorate
the situation?

Institutionally, even amidst euphemistical ""downsizing"" (for this read
""getting a bonus for laying off employees""), there are nevertheless hopeful
signs. Let me cite just a few with which I have been directly or indirectly
involved; I'm sure news of others would be very welcome. One of the hopeful
events I have for you affects the near-future of Humanist; this seems a
particularly apt moment to tell you about it.

First, two recent meetings of considerable significance.

One was the annual gathering of the American Council of Learned Societies,
in Washington, DC, U.S.A., 25-27 April, where five of us participated in a
panel, ""Internet-accessible scholarly resources for the humanities and
social sciences"". The participants were Susan Hockey (Director, CETH,
Princeton/Rutgers), Jennifer Trant (Imaging Initiative, Getty Art History
Information Program), Charles Henry (Director of Libraries, Vassar), and
Richard Rockwell (Executive Director, Inter-University Consortium for
Political and Social Research); I, representing Humanist, was the
commentator. What made this event significant was, I think, the fact of its
being held at all, at this annual meeting. Such recognition of computing by
the ACLS follows just a few months on Humanist becoming its adjunct
publication, and a few more months on ACLS President Stan Katz's address at
the ACH/ALLC conference in Santa Barbara, at which he identified computing
as one of the most important priorities of the academy for the next decade.

The second was a special meeting convened last week at the National
Humanities Center, in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, U.S.A., to
discuss the role computing should have in advanced humanities research, and
specifically how the NHC should support its fellows with computing, even to
encouraging computing applications. This meeting was divided into seven
sessions, following NHC Director Robert Connor's summary of the history and
goals of his Center. Five of these sessions consisted of brief presentations
based on questions set by Robert Wright, Director of Development; two others
were for discussion.
  1. Susan Hockey, David Seaman: Advanced technologies, resources, and access
  2. Morris Eaves, George Landow, Ann Okerson: Scholarship, publication, and
     and scholarly publications
  3. Jacqueline Brown, Janet Murray: Teaching and curricular applications
  4. Larry Friedlander, Institutional, professional, and disciplinary issues
  5. Willard McCarty, John Unsworth: The role of colleges and universities,
     research libraries, professional organizations, and institutes for
     advanced study
Again, the significant fact to my mind was that the NHC would take such
trouble to consider the nature of humanities computing before incorporating
it into its mission. I expect we will be hearing much more from the NHC later.

At the beginning of this message I referred to the original motivation for
Humanist, which was to establish humanities computing as a scholarly field.
Humanist quickly became international and so took on a much broader purpose.
Meanwhile institutions, which are conservative by nature, have been slow to
respond, but responses are now visible. Numerous places appear to have
worked computing into new academic positions in traditional departments
(reports on these would be welcome). In other cases, most notably for N.
America at Oberlin College, computer science has adopted the humanities as a
major focus. New positions in humanities computing itself have been slower
to develop, but there are a few: at Glasgow (Dan Greenstein), at McMaster,
in Ontario, Canada (Geoffrey Rockwell), for many years at Groningen, the
Netherlands (Harry Gaylord) and at Tuebingen (Wilhelm Ott). Which others
have I missed?

I am especially happy to announce :-) one other, at King's College London,
where I have just been appointed Senior Lecturer in Humanities Computing, in
an academic unit known as the Centre for Computing in the Humanities.
Although the technical and administrative details of Humanist have yet to be
worked out completely, I will be editing Humanist from London, probably as
of mid August. In the interim, with help, I trust there will be few
interruptions, but I suspect the chaos of a major move will occasionally
intrude. Your kind patience will be appreciated.

So, on the ninth anniversary of Humanist we may have reason to think that
our half-full glass, like the magical wallet of folktale, is slowly filling
itself up. As a child I always thought that the number 9 was a threshold, as
far as one could go without stepping over into a new cycle. Since I am as
good at walking on water as my cats, my personal step over the threshold is
a rather large one. (Prolonged study of Milton, some of you will notice, has
left its mental mark.)

On the verge, my best wishes and warmest regards to fellow Humanists. Happy
Birthday!

As the summer approaches, many of you might not be checking your e-mail
regularly, might be forwarding your mail to other addresses, or might be
considering using an automated reply to indicate that you will be
unavailable for a certain period of time.  Although these three situations
present few problems for personal, individual correspondance, they can be
quite a headache for listserv administration and automated e-mail
distribution. I therefore make the following requests:

1) If you will not be checking your e-mail, and you have a disk quota,
please postpone your subscription.  Once your disk quota has been exceeded,
the messages we send will start being bounced back to us, and we will
eventually need to delete your subscription.

2) If you are forwarding your mail to a different address, please remember
that you will not be able to post messages or communicate with the
ListProcessor from  your new address.  As far as the list is concerned, you
are still subscribed at your regular address, regardless of where the mail
ends up going.  Anything you send with therefore be automatically rejected.
If you would like to post a message or change your subscription parameters
in some way, you need to telnet to the account at which you are subscribed
and send mail from there.

3) If you set up your e-mail to make an automatic reply to all messages
received, we will receive that reply often a dozen or more times a week.
All such messages will appear as potential posts to Humanist, and we will
have to delete them manually. The automated reply may be useful for
individual correspondents, but it causes many problems for list
administration.  If you are planning to use it, please postpone your
subscription.

As always, if you have any questions about how to configure your
subscription using listproc, that information is available on the Humanist
web pages.  Please feel free to ask me any questions you might have if your
circumstances are not covered by the available instructions.

The latest TLS, for 16 May 1998, is a particularly interesting issue from
our perspective. The theme is psychology. The cover is graced, if that's the
word, with a digital image from the Internet, apparently of Marshall
Applewhite, the leader of the Heaven's Gate cult who went to the space-ship
traveling behind Hale-Bopp. The items of particular interest for us, other
than the origins of the digital image, are reviews by (1) Jerry Fodor, of
Jeffrey L. Elman, et al., Rethinking Innateness, (2) Daniel C. Dennett, of
Andy Clark, Being There: Putting brain, body, and the world together again,
(3) Mark S. Micale, of Elaine Showalter, Hystories: Hysterical epidemics and
modern culture. Other things as well, but those three are the main ones.

Fodor, in his typical style, demolishes the dodges of Rethinking Innateness
in particular and the purely empirical approach to knowledge in general.
""Whether mental content can be reduced to experiential content is what the
present argument in cognitive science is really about."" He finds the
empiricist programme hidden in the connectionist approach, and in that
programme nothing but failure. What I find interesting is driving in the
other direction -- beginning with the empirical data, then trying to get to
what one knows about e.g. poetry, asking how, and spotting the interesting
failures of empirical analysis.

Dennett gives high marks to Andy Clark's book, ""a unified, judicious vision
of the progress that has actually been made [in cognitive science], a survey
of the state of play today that [captures] what is powerful and promising in
these new ideas without succumbing to the hype."" Required reading, it seems.

Showalter's book has already been mentioned here in the context of how
electronic communication has aided the spread of hysterical diseases, from
scares about computer viruses to maladies of the mind and flesh. This book
should outrage many people because it presumes to question the scientific
nature of how medical science conducts itself, pointing out how a sense of
personal frustration can translate into recognition of a new disease, thence
to a new medical subspeciality with all the trappings. ""These are acutely
communicable diseases. As a result, vulnerable and impressionable viewers
exposed to the illness model engage in a kind of psychogenic
self-fashioning. The mental-health establishment, responding to what it sees
as a new psychopathology (and an emerging patient population), adds the
diagnosis to its list of official diagnoses.... The Internet instantaneously
disseminates information across the world. (The World Wide Web lists dozens
of on-line publications and organizations for survivors of psychological
traumata.)...."" It should be noted that Showalter does not deny that people
genuinely suffer, rather she turns a strong light on how they get sick. The
Internet plays a role!

++++++++++++++++++

If this activity is of interest to you or your colleagues, please visit
http://www.wordcruncher.com for additional information:

WordCruncher Publishing Technologies and Mike LoMonico, a nationally
renowned expert in using electronic tools to teach Shakespeare, are teaming
up to provide students from throughout the United States with a unique
opportunity. By using an electronic version of Macbeth in combination with
WordCruncher,  our proprietary text retrieval and analysis program, we help
students craft discovery strategies of their own design, and enable them to
explore
Shakespeare's language in ways that are simply impossible without the
computer. The techniques we use were pioneered and tested at The Folger
Shakespeare Library, and we are confident that both teachers and students
will find this approach to be an enjoyable, thought provoking activity that
lends a new dimension to education and learning.

The course takes place between May 12th and May 26th, and entails several
exercises:=20

Lesson 1, Part 1 - Thou Marvel'st at My Words: Helps students understand
what archaic words mean and how they are used.=20

Lesson 1, Part 2 - Thou Marvel'st at My Words (con't): Helps students
understand that modern words have archaic meanings.

Lesson 2 - The Like to You - Helps students understand how Shakespeare used
simile.

Lesson 3 - Look to the Lady ^=D6 Helps students understand how Shakespeare
approached the ideas of women, wives, and motherhood in Macbeth.

Lesson 4 - 'Tis Time, 'Tis Time ^=D6 Teaches students about the concept of
""time"" in Macbeth.

If you, your class or a few of your students would like to participate in
or audit the Virtual Macbeth, please send us an e-mail message to
johnston@wordcruncher.com and we will forward=20
instructions on how to prepare, what kind of computer you will need, and so
on.=20

Details on the first assignment will be posted on Monday, May 12th at 7:00
am, eastern standard time (US). We will have a chat forum up all the time,
so that students from across the country (and even the world) will be able
to participate. We will be posting additional information as this week (May
5-9) proceeds, so please check back often.=20

Happy birthday, Humanist.  I address here the old timers among you, from
the days when there were giants on the earth, Kessler and Paramskas and
Brown and Flanagan, to say nothing of Sire Willard the Prime Mover.  One
of Humanist's spinoffs somewhere around 1990 was ARACHNET, a separate list
for discussion of scholarly publishing, a sort of meta-list for talking
*about* things like Humanist but e-journals as well.  I'm on a small
self-assigned mission to track down that list and its archives, if they
exist, to recover a sense of what people thought possible and desirable
back at the dawn of recorded history, this at a moment when a list I
co-moderate, NewJour, reports over 3700 existing e-journals and we know
that we are scrambling just to keep from falling further behind in
reporting them.  An Alta Vista search on Arachnet shows mainly tha",Converted_Text,1997-1998,,,,

X-Humanist: Vol. 12 Num. 1 (1)


Karl Meninger, in Number Words and Number Symbols, confirms that eleven,
like 12, is a strange number in many languages, formed differently from
those that come before and those that follow. In childhood I recall
thinking, up to the time of my 12th birthday and into the year it began,
that 12 was the perfect age. The teens I associated with acute discomfort,
embarrassment and profound physiological change -- nothing to look forward
to, though certain of the rewards did seem tantalizing indeed. They still
do... and are. No such special status, though perhaps born of fear, I ever
accorded to being 11. It was apparently not memorable. A time out of time, a
dull-featured passage from childhood to the celebrated verge, with the
dreaded but exciting turbulence beyond.

The way we count birthdays is, of course, ambiguous. Humanist's eleventh
birthday, today in fact, is the beginning of its 12th year and completion of
its 11th, so from that point of view we are entering the perfect age. (Note
the volume and issue number of this message.) This is, of course, what I
hope for on behalf of us all. I was not so given to seeing the ambiguities
and ironies as a child, however, so all those associations really belong to
the Humanist-year beginning May 1999, the last of the 20th century and the
second millenium. Generosity here (or is it muddled sloppiness?) allows me
roughly to mark the beginning of Humanist's second decade with my own move
to a new land and so a profound psycho-social reconstruction, which of
course is still in progress. My no-man's eleventh, between the North
American first ten and who knows how many following these here in England,
has been anything but featureless, rather a time of more profound change
than ever I could have imagined.

Looking over the last year of Humanist I don't see an analogous change,
rather more or less of a steady-state. Our seminar some years ago lost its
early prominence amidst the crowd of its children (if I may presume), just
as my generation of pioneering computing humanists found themselves no
longer so special. It's commonplace now for the likes of us to feel, as one
of my friends put it vividly last year, like we're sitting in the middle of
the road with tire-tracks going up our back. As a researcher and scholar I
don't feel that way at all, but professionally one does get the sense that
the Action has gone elsewhere. We do not tend to be the ones whom government
ministers consult and newspaper reporters interview. Text-analysis does not
make the headlines. Being in the backwater is not entirely a bad thing, of
course; traditionally it has been where humanists have preferred to be. But
I have been inspired recently to ponder on the question of how we make the
connection between what we do and what the society at large (which supports
us) wants or needs. Difficult one, that. People at the level of the British
Academy and its equivalents elsewhere are, I know, worrying about such
things, because unless this connection is made, they argue, our kind may
vanish.

This evening I was listening, as I usually do, to Radio 4 while preparing
dinner, to a programme about the successful applications of connectionist AI
to decision-making in government. The man narrating the programme concluded
rather uncomfortably by saying that we really should be discussing such
potential for profound social change and social control now, openly,
frequently, loudly. ""Where are the public debates about these issues?"" he
asked.

On Humanist, of course, though perhaps not as often as they need to be.
Looking over the messages of the last year -- as we all can easily, thanks
to the Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities (IATH, Virginia)
-- I am struck repeatedly by how rich and interesting our chatter is. Who
knows what the juices of adolescence in the turn of the millenium will do to
us. We've had a robust childhood, however, so needn't be worried -- as long
as we can keep on talking, and like serious youths everywhere, develop a
strain of idealism strong enough to outlast all the world's adult
carborundum.

Happy Birthday to you all!


Yours,
WM

Transformations: Technology, Foreign Languages, and Undergraduate Education

The Consortium for Language Teaching and Learning and the Section on
Foreign Languages & Literatures at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology are pleased to announce a national conference, October 23-25,
1998.

Intended for foreign language faculty, administrators, directors of
humanities computing, and language laboratory directors, this conference
will examine the transformations of the foreign language classroom, the
role of the teacher, the institutional mission, the curriculum, and the
infrastructure in the light of developments in multimedia computer
technology. The conference will not be an occasion for demonstrating
hardware and software. Instead, it seeks to pose new questions about
fundamental changes that all foreign language programs and all institutions
are currently undergoing.

Speakers will include Jacqueline Brown (Princeton University), Gilberte
Furstenberg (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Henry Jenkins
(Massachusetts Institute of Technology), William A. Johnson (Bucknell
University), Yoko Koike (Haverford College), Claire Kramsch (University of
California at Berkeley), Karen Landahl (University of Chicago), James S.
Noblitt (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), Slava Paperno
(Cornell University), and Thomas Thornton (Massachusetts Institute of
Technology).

The conference will be held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Cambridge, Massachusetts, beginning Friday afternoon, October 23, 1998, and
concluding mid-day, Sunday, October 25, 1998.

Subject: disciplinarity, mad cows and smoke
Date: Fri, 08 May 1998 22:33:46 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 12 Num. 4 (4)


For those interested in the rise, fall and mutation of academic disciplines
-- in their contingency -- the latest issue of the Times Literary Supplement
(4962 for 8 May 1998) has much of interest. The discipline in question is
anthropology. I found especially instructive the review of Marcus Banks and
Howard Morphy, eds., Rethinking Visual Anthropology (Yale UP), by Paul
Henley, ""Seeing is understanding"". I find the mutability and overall
contingency of disciplines interesting in the context of humanities
computing, as a good counter to those who take a principled stand against
the scholarly nature of our practice on the basis that it is not a
""discipline"". Red herring.

Another article of interest is A. M. Daniels, ""Coughing up: The unholy
alliance between greed and puritanism"", reviewing Peter Pringle, Dirty
Business: Big tobacco at the bar of justice (Aurum). One of the
text-analysis projects I have been tempted to give to students is an
analysis of the collected online texts pertaining to tobacco, of which there
are many. They bear out what Daniels is saying, that the whole issue is shot
through with multiple ironies. I have done a similar project using online
texts concerning BSE/CJD (bovine spongiform encephalopathy / Creuzfeld-Jacob
disease), a.k.a. Mad Cow Disease. These, and I suspect the tobacco ones as
well, move among three positions, or did more clearly before the current
government was elected: the Major government, in deep denial that BSE was a
problem; the scientists (those not in the hire of the former), who were
getting on with the research; and the newspapers, interested in selling
papers by stirring up, shall we say, public concern. For text-analysis
purposes these are just right, since with certain key words (e.g. ""body"")
you can pick apart the texts fairly well for their poli",Converted_Text,1998-1999,,,,

X-Humanist: Vol. 13 Num. 1 (1)


Dear Colleagues:

Most of you will know from having been around Humanist's barn at least once
that on this day each year I commemorate the beginning of our seminar, 7
May 1987, when I was mccarty@utorepas (like Alcuin of York :-), knew next
to nothing about e-mail and very likely would have experienced total
cerebral meltdown had I known what the subsequent 12 years would bring.
Like many things Humanist changed very quickly at first, developing into a
robust entity by virtue of several crises and a stalwart, intelligent
membership. As I've said a number of times, the best thing I did then was
to let it find its way. As it has. For the last several years, however,
Humanist has held to a steady state, hovering around 1,100 members -- or,
rather, subscriptions; several of these are redistribution points. At one
time we did a yearly review of activities, but that grew to be too much of
a burden. In any case, I'm not threatening you here with a retrospection,
rather an introspection. I admit that looking at the subject lines of the
messages in the archive at IATH (Virginia) for volume 12 (1998-99) I am
greatly cheered and encouraged by the richness and variety of discussion.
We have every reason to expect this to continue through volume 13, into the
(oh yes) next millennium.

In 1900 the German mathematician David Hilbert gave a justly famous lecture
in Paris, ""Mathematische Probleme"", in which he surveyed his discipline and
set forth a programme of research for the century ahead. I doubt we can
quite manage that for humanities computing at the moment (though I continue
to try, and we have another year), but the lecture, translated into English
and put online at <http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/hilbert/problems.html>,
is instructive for the highly pragmatic view Hilbert took of his field,
asking what it needed to continue to be vital. He pointed out that a vital
field is one which has problems of its own to work on, and that these
problems must be at the right level of difficulty so as to be challenging
but not overwhelming. Mathematicians have different sorts of problems than
we do, of course, but mutatis mutandis we can learn from his approach. It's
about time we did some work on what the research agenda of humanities
computing might be, to get past the silly stage of ""yes it has!"" / ""no it
hasn't!"". In fact my first inclination for a more than phatic happy
birthday to Humanist is to suggest that in the year ahead we put on
Hilbert's mantle and give ourselves, through discussion here, real work to do.

My second inclination is simply to celebrate with unreckonable gratitude
the existence of this electronic seminar through its 12th birthday. Forgive
me, if you will, for becoming personal, but, hey, I do this just once a
year (ok, twice, counting Christmas :-), and the delete key is not far off.
Just in case the love in this labour of love is not obvious, I here declare
it, and for an excuse I point out that I am far gone in my cups at this
birthday party. ""A liquor never brewed [drunk] from tankards scooped in
pearl"" is to blame, but I have more than one reason for drinking it.
Another wonderfully simultaneous cause for celebration possesses me... but
there are limits even to the license I give myself, and besides, this other
event (to quote Northrop Frye in the acknowledgements to The Great Code)
goes beyond the orbit of words altogether, and requires nothing short of a
Million Dollar Bash -- which it will get.

I have had many occasions in this past year to think about long hauls and
what it might be that over them keeps very different people together,
talking productively as so often happens here, and makes a community out of
the aggregate. Endurance and an open channel of communication are necessary
but not sufficient. The channel has to be frequently used, especially when
it is entirely virtual, as with Humanist, and so is quickly forgotten if
not exercised. Chit-chat may indirectly communicate matters of considerable
importance, and I suppose to a degree everything we say is chit-chat with
respect to the unsayable on which we triangulate. Nevertheless clear
thinking and care in getting it right, especially against the incrustations
of habit and dumbing down from received thought, seem to me absolutely
essential to the marriage of true minds in a seminar worth holding, as in a
life worth living. Effort, despite best intentions and skill, is of course
not enough. Something else is required -- a court and spark of identity?
something genuine, something more discovered than created, around which to
gather?

Like everyone else I am still working on the larger human problem, but for
Humanist the explanation for our survival, it seems to me, is quite clear.
We talk because we have things to say; we talk together because these
things constitute a coherent perspective, whose pursuit is a scholarly
activity. We may not quite have the choreography of what we do just yet,
but we will.

Meanwhile, congratulations to Humanist! Now begins our adolescence, and
with Blake's ""Glad Day"" in mind I promise you that

When ""Landlords"" turn the drunken Bee
Out of the Foxglove's door --
When Butterflies renounce their ""drams""
I shall but drink the more!

Till Seraphs swing their snowy Hats
And Saints to windows run
To see the little Tippler
Leaning against the Sun.

Yours,
WM

Subject: 12.0610 TEI and...: The Gadfly Notes
Date: Fri, 07 May 1999 07:25:02 +0100
X-Humanist: Vol. 13 Num. 2 (2)


I suspect that I am one of the guilty parties of whom Michael writes
in his post on [12.0610] ""TEI and the individual scholar"",
[deleted quotation]
I considered very carefully the potential costs and benefits of
using TEI-Lite, and even full TEI, as the mark-up scheme that we
would use in our new generation search engine, known as PhiloLogic,
before deciding on a much simpler encoding, which we are calling ATE
(ARTFL Text Encoding).  ATE is essentially Dublin Core Metadata,
basic HTML, and some optional extensions.

My primary consideration was, and still is, where might I make the
best investment of development effort.  I decided that any attempt
to build recognizers that would handle all of the possibilities of
TEI (or other SGML) DTDs would require a very significant development
effort all by itself.  So, rather than include what would effectively
be a full SGML parser into the system, I decided that we would use
existing SGML parsers (such as Jim Clark's) to reduce all of the
variations to a small subset.  SGML parsers are complex systems
and we have found that one must a handle a consider amount of variation
from database to database, and even text to text when dealing with
TEI encoded documents.  Trying to build that capability into a
large scale text search and navigation engine would, I fear, be far
beyond ARTFL's means.

It is, thus, not particularly surprising to me that the fully SGML
aware systems that have appeared are very expensive, when they are
sold to the academic market at all, and tend not to be all
that effective for the kinds of functions that I think are useful because
they are designed more as corporate document management systems.  I am
also not surprised that Michael has found a generally cool reception
amongst other developers in humanities computing.  This stuff is really
hard and expensive to do and, so far, I have not seen the possibility of
radically extended functionality that would warrant the investment.

With all of the discussion of text *tagging*, little thought has been
given to development of systems much beyond how to render individual
documents in a browser.  At a certain point, when writing a system,
every tag, every attribute, every variation has to be handled
or ignored.  It is easy to develop very extensive tagsets that can
be demonstrated to balance using an SGML/XML parser/verifier.  It is
MUCH, MUCH harder to develop systems that know what to do with each
and every tag/value/attribute/whatever.  The burden and cost of doing
*SOMETHING* with all of the possibilities has been passed to the
developer.  It's hard enough to do this as is, particularly within
the limited resources of most huanities computing outfits, so a cool
reaction to a specification that entails alot more effort is to be
expected.

Now, the next point in the discussion is that if nobody in humanities
computing can afford to develop software to handle all of the
potential variations richly encoded documents, then you gotta ask, why
encode that heavily?  Michael suggests,
[deleted quotation]
Tired as he might be, I hope that he does **NOT** take the cynic's
view.  It is not nearly as stark a contrast as he might be inclined
to believe.  The lofty and laudable goals of Michael's vision of the
TEI have to be balanced by the fact that we do not live in the best
of all possible worlds.  Humanists who work with computers are faced
with a very significant set of limitations and restrictions, ranging
from very tight budgets [if you are lucky enough to have a budget
at all], to the need to produce systems for users, my problem, or
published research results, the problem for many other scholars,
in a relatively short time frames.

It is in trying to achieve this balance that I have declared myself to
be a very strong supporter of the intellectual goals of the TEI and,
at the same time, presented significant criticisms from a more practical
perspective.  I would not, to be frank, waste my time criticizing the
TEI if I were not completely convinced of the very high val",Converted_Text,1999-2000,,,,

Dear Colleagues:

Thirteen years ago today Humanist began as an experiment on the strength of an

inspiration that somehow something good would come of it. Many good things

have, for me the most important of them quite unexpectedly. You may not

count these yearly editorial ruminations among those good things :-), but I

do hope that you, like me, welcome the chance to stop for a moment and

think about Humanist in the context of our field(s) of activity and the

loosely bound, widely distributed community of people -- some of them of

long-standing, some of them new and, alas, some of them gone -- that

Humanist has helped to define. None of us has the time to review the past

year-in-Humanist, and I trust none is so foolish as to attempt prediction

of the one we begin today. I'll certainly do neither. Cook's privilege is

to taste the cooking, editor's to say whatever he or she likes. Permit me

to combine those roles in a very personal way. I often think that what I do

under the rubric of editor is to stir the pot, so here goes.

Permit me also, please, to draw on experience without your attributing to

the act the qualities of age that may seem inseparable from it. Especially

the greybeardedness. That colour and my beard are not unrelated, but the

sedentary gravitas and settled authority that greybeards can so easily put

on I find personally dead wrong and professionally suicidal. I hope that

it's entirely unnecessary to say that the joy of being alive is simply too

unsettling to make greybeardedness an attractive mental state, or as my

poet Ovid wrote about a not entirely dissimilar situation, ""non bene

conveniunt nec in una sede morantur / maiestas et amor..."" (Met 2.846f). As

for our field, it changes too quickly. New vistas -- such as new media

studies, now not so new -- open up, and suddenly we need to reconfigure

what we think and how we think, publish and teach it. Greybeards are likely

to end up, to quote Peter Batke, feeling as if they're sitting in the

middle of the road with tire tracks up their back.

Perhaps the most valuable thing I can say about the very beginning of

Humanist is the autobiographical fact of its originating inspiration. It

came to me, suddenly in a meeting of like-minded, more or less unrecognised

and quite disgruntled academics 13 years ago, that there was 'something for

me' in the effort to bring us together and define what we were doing  -- no

more, really, than a whiff of something good on the wind. I think the

professional analogue to this personal incident and the crucial role of

sudden inspiration in my life that it points to is, again, the vital

necessity for our being alert. We're not at the bleeding edge of

technological developments, thank God, but as new things come over the

horizon we have but a short time to see what we might adopt, adapt or take

note of for our colleagues in the humanities and for our students.

The most valuable thing I can say about the practice of editing Humanist is

again to quote the Hebrew proverb, ""Do what you do only out of love."" If

years ago I'd had sight of the future, and I'd seen what good things

Humanist would do for me professionally, I might have been irresistibly

tempted to go for it out of hope for professional advancement etc., but

blessed blindness to the future saved me from being tested and very likely

found wanting. By the time it became clear that Humanist would be useful in

that way my love for it was too strong to be unseated by those strange

gods. In any case, the privilege of being involved through Humanist in the

beginnings of humanities computing is very great indeed, and I can only be

profoundly grateful.

Many are to thank -- some who have helped deliberately, others accidentally

and a few who intended a rather different result and taught important

lessons thereby. Allow me, however, for the first time to dedicate the

moment to Don Fowler, late of Jesus College Oxford, who was just the sort

of colleague and friend we need to remind us of why we do this thing and

why greybeardedness is not to die for. ""Therefore choose life!""

Many thanks.

Yours,

WM

Conference announcement and call for papers

Subject Knowledges and Professional Practice in the Arts and Humanities

The Humanities and Arts higher education Network's 6th annual conference

will be held on the 7th October, 2000 at the Open University, Milton Keynes.

http://iet.open.ac.uk/research/herg/han/index.htm

In the context of the technologically-driven 'information revolution' what

we mean by Subject Knowledge is being questioned and re-assessed - for

example, through the QAA's Subject Benchmarking activities and the new ESRC

research programme 'The evolution of knowledge: interaction of research and

practice?'.

The conference will debate the question: is contemporary Professional

Practice - with its emphasis on delivery of learning outcomes and

information, on skills acquisition, etc., across all academic disciplines -

at odds with traditional conceptions of subject knowledges in the arts and

humanities, how and why they are taught and learned?

Presentations in response to this question are sought, with respect to any

of the arts and humanities disciplines.  Participatory sessions, in which

conference delegates are directly involved, are particularly welcome.

Deadline for outline proposals: Friday July 14th.

The attendance fee will be 40, with a concessionary rate of 25 for members

of the Humanities and Arts higher education Network (HAN) and full-time

students.

For more information about submitting a proposal, joining HAN (membership is

free) or attending the conference, please contact Kelvin Lack

(k.j.lack@open.ac.uk) or visit the HAN web site at

Literature)

Dear Prof. Jennifer de Beer and Prof. Willard McCarty,

It is really amazing to see, the works of Prof. N. Katherine Hayles,

who has created a sensation amongst the scholars round the globe, by

writing a bold book, ""How We Became Posthuman"". But, most of the scholars

and researchers don't know that, her POSTHUMAN graphical presentation is

also available online to read and use in their teaching schedules. During

my cyberexplorations, I came across her ""Posthuman"" Hypertext -It looks to

me that she was using the graphical texts in her teaching at the Institute

for Theoretical Physics of University of California, Santa Barbara. at

<http://online.itp.ucsb.edu> Also, a near dear friend of Prof. Hayles,

Prof. Albert Borgmann, who wrote another bold book, ""Holding On To Reality""

has sent me a comment, ""Arun, who animates the Internet"". I think he is

right to some extent. I and Internet, most of the times, feel is One.

The On-Line graphical travels begin with ""The Human"", which can be found

at: <http://online.itp.ucsb.edu/online/colloq/hayles1/oh/01.html> -This is

the starting thread..your journey will be beginning from this very

hypertext..in all, there are 22 graphical hypertexts are available for

the visit. The graphical travel is a beginning of the references regarding

""Liberal Humanist Subject"" to the next ""Dismantling of the Liberal Humanist

Subject""..there she tried to classify the *Cybernetics* in Two Periods..to

next the train of graphical hypertext stops at some references regarding

""Virtuality"" and ""The Posthuman""..and then the significant ""Split"" is taken

place as, *How Important is Embodiment to Posthuman?* and from the slide 6,

the travel enters into the era of ""Contemporary Literature"" explaining the

*Images of the Posthuman* and *Materiality*.
[deleted quotation]
<http://online.itp.ucsb.edu/online/colloq/hayles1/oh/09.html>

you will read an excerpt from his latest book..the Excerpt is about *How

Does It Mean To Be Posthuman?* and *What are we to make of the

Posthuman?* The slide further goes to 13 more and by then you will be

reading more great and tantalising references regarding the Posthuman.

Travel of Posthuman ends..and now you might also be interested to

know..that..

X-Humanist: Vol. 15 Num. 1 (1)


Dear colleagues:

A recurrent complaint on Humanist used to be visited upon newcomers who

would ask questions the older members thought had already been delt with.

At some point in a discussion following upon such a complaint, one of us

observed that repetition is a device characteristic of oral cultures, a

means of maintaining group memory, and that online discussion groups behave

in several respects like them. Whether that is good anthropology,

repetition seems necessary here, since people come and go, and for those of

us who stay much happens in a year and we are apt to forget. Thus my

apology comes with the sunrise over London.

Every year at this time custom is, some will remember independently, for me

to celebrate the birthday of Humanist (b. 7 May 1987) by writing whatever

comes to mind of a corporately self-reflective nature. We're 14 years old

now, a venerable age in this medium, like everything else somewhere between

coming into being and going out of it, ""like the swift flight of a single

sparrow through the banqueting-hall where you are sitting at dinner on a

winter's day with your thegns and counsellors. In the midst there is a

comforting fire to warm the hall; outside, the storms of winter rain or

snow are raging. This sparrow flies swiftly in through one door of the hall

and out through another. While he is inside, he is safe from the winter

storms; but after a few moments of comfort, he vanishes from sight into the

wintry world from which he came."" Thus a councillor to Edwin, King of

Northumbria, in 627, encouraging him to convert to Christianity while he

can (Bede, Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation II.13). So, let us

pass the mead and tell some more stories!

I do listen to the stories we tell and think we have every reason to be

cheered when looking up from our plates and cups to take account of the

feasting. A fair bit of what happens here is of course reporting on the

newsy bits -- jobs, conferences, publications, project updates -- as a scan

through vol 14 will show. My impression is of a steady-state, but there are

changes.

The number of adverts for jobs more or less in humanities computing has,

for example, increased steadily: by my rough count of messages, some

advertising more than one job, in the 5 years since 1996 (when I got mine

here) from 14 to 28, 30, then 40 for the last 2 years. Others, major

academic appointments, are cooking, as yet unadvertised. Diversification

outside the academy is a very interesting phenomenon. See Humanist 14.0832,

""job-seeker help at ACH/ALLC"", our upcoming professional conference at NYU

in June, <http://www.nyu.edu/its/humanities/ach_allc2001/>. (Be there or be

square.) Indeed, we are rapidly reaching the point at which there are not

enough qualified applicants for advertised jobs in the field -- which

suggests more than a little urgency to our efforts in (post)graduate

training. But that, too, is happening. I note with great interest the

amount of attention being paid to MA programmes at ACH/ALLC

(<http://www.nyu.edu/its/humanities/ach_allc2001/program.html>), sessions

4A on 14/6, ""MA Programmes for Humanities Computing and Digital Media"", and

9A on 16/6, ""A Masters Degree in Digital Humanities at the University of

Virginia"". Mazel tov! But of course much more is needed, including

discussion here about what we want to go into our programmes, which I

suspect remains too narrowly conceived. (Like philosophy or history I think

we can lay claim to a piece of *everything* :-)

Evident on Humanist and at ACH/ALLC is the rapid increase in attention to

computing the visual. Some of us are now making our way professionally,

even in traditionally word-only disciplines, with primary attention to the

visual -- or should we say, the artefactual? Is the buzz coming from seeing

as such, or from a more complete realisation of the physically embodied

nature of knowledge? We simply cannot get away from the need to cast our

interdisciplinary net as widely as the mind will stretch -- in this case to

the mind/body problem in the philosophy of mind and the soul/body problem

in the history of religion, as well as the form/content problem in lots of

different places.

Then there's my very own flavour of the month, the ongoing hypertext

debate, e.g. continuing in this first batch of postings for vol. 15 from a

thread running in recent days in Humanist 14.0817, 822, 827 by Michael

Sperberg-McQueen, Patrick Durusau, Fotis Janidis, Adrian Miles and myself.

The question is, what's new about hypertext? This, it turns out, is a hard

question, and thanks to Patrick's relentless nothing-moreism assertions in

principle won't wash. Of course there's a fair bit of rubbish-removal

needed around a topic so vexed by the evangelistic groupies, but beyond the

clearing of throats it does seem to me that we're getting down once again

to the intellectual nitty-gritty that I cannot help but think lies at our

centre. My recent attempt to wrap my mind around hypertext research (see

the of course always out-of-date

<http://ilex.cc.kcl.ac.uk/wlm/essays/achallc2000/hyperbib.html>) tells me

we have a great deal of interdisciplinary bibliographic trawling and

synthesising to do, but also that we're onto a vein of rich intellectual

ore. One of course hopes for eye-opening insights in discussions like this

one, but even if particular sets of eyes aren't opened by it, at least the

vigorous debate serves as memorable caution that there's more to the matter

than we've realised so far.

""What is required"", Alan Kay wrote in 1991, ""is a kind of guerilla warfare,

not to stamp out new media (or old) but to create a parallel consciousness

about media -- one that gently whispers the debits and credits of any

representation and points the way to the 'food'"" (""Computers, Networks and

Education.""  Scientific American 265.3, p. 141). We shall not cease from

mental fight &c. -- which late one Monday night months ago I heard some old

men, very far into their cups, singing in my local. To paraphrase a famous

haiku in the Anglo-Saxon mode, ""Slowly, o sparrow, fly through through the

mead-hall!""

Enough. The day progresses. I must check on the progress of a particular

debate in my inner hall, at some point attend to a rosemary bush that is

really getting out of hand and see to the removal of a wine-stain on my

carpet. So, allow me leave to wish you all well and to extend hearty

gratitude for your part in this wonderful, long conversation.

Happy birthday!

Yours,

WM

It certainly depends on your definition of 'meaningful'. I wanted to

start with a more basic description of the differences between

footnotes and hyperlinks to have a sound basis for further

discussion. 'more accessible' is just one aspect of this. The fact

that links are machine readable is probably more important,

because it is the fundament for totally new approaches to

knowledge management. All internet search engines mainly rely on

hyperlinks to create their map of the internet and the same applies

to new approaches like Tim Berners-Lee idea of the semantic web

(""The Semantic Web is a vision: the idea of having data on the

Web defined and linked in a way that it can be used by machines

not just for display purposes, but for automation, integration and

reuse of data across various applications.""

http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Activity) or the topic maps. All these

developments are based on features of hyperlink which are

marginalized, if you focus the discussion on the mind of the reader.
[deleted quotation]
Actually I don't know, but I would have chosen the comparison with

the development of punctuation marks and I do think that a wider

spread of changes like using space between words or clearly

seperating sentences or paragraphs indicates a change in reading

practice and also further stimulates change.
[deleted quotation]
Empirical studies like the one collected by Jean-Franois Rouet u.a.

(Hg.): Hypertext and Cognition. Mahwah, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum

1996, do indicate that there are differences in the use of hypertexts,

p.e. the 'lost in hypertext' symptom and the possibility to overcome

it with training. The authors very decidedly denounce the parallel

between hypertext reading and the working of the human mind.

The mere amount of links in larger hypertexts, especially the

internet, creates a qualitative difference (at some point quantitative

changes become a qualitative one).
[deleted quotation]
In a short text of the young Goethe there are lots of footnotes and

in the footnotes are references to the special verses of the bible.

Every professional reader will probably follow all footnote reference

to the bottom of the page, but only a very few will go on and follow

the reference to the bible - there seems to be a stable economic

trait in humans. With a hypertext edition containing the Goethe

text and the bible you can read all reference in a few minutes and it

seems to me to be sound guess that more people will do this. Just

a quantitative difference, but at some point ...

     Archiving the Avant Garde: Documenting and Preserving Variable Media Art

               http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/ciao/avant_garde.html

Below is the outline of a new consortial project aimed at the

problems of collecting, documenting, and preserving digital art,

and other variable media art forms. The project includes mechanisms

for broad input from artists and other professionals and the designers

are curious to hear of other current efforts relating to these same

problems. Comments to

[deleted quotation]
ARCHIVING THE AVANT GARDE: DOCUMENTING AND PRESERVING VARIABLE MEDIA ART

Works of variable media art, such as performance, installation,

conceptual, and digital art, represent some of the most compelling

and significant artistic creation of our time. These works are key to

understanding contemporary art practice and scholarship, but because

of their ephemeral, technical, multimedia, or otherwise variable

natures, they also present significant obstacles to accurate

documentation, access, and preservation.

The works were in many cases created to challenge traditional methods of

art description and preservation, but now, lacking such description, they

often comprise the more obscure aspects of institutional collections, virtually

inaccessible to present day researchers. Without strategies for cataloging

and preservation, many of these vital works will eventually be lost to art

history.

Description of and access to art collections promote new scholarship and

artistic production. By developing ways to catalog and preserve these

collections, we will both provide current and future generations the

opportunity to learn from and be inspired by the works and ensure the

perpetuation and

accuracy of art historical records. It is to achieve these goals that

we are initiating the consortium project Archiving the Avant Garde:

Documenting and Preserving Variable Media Art.

The collaboration includes of the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive

(BAM/PFA), the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Walker Art Center,

Rhizome.org, the Franklin Furnace Archive, and the Cleveland Performance

Art Festival and Archive.

On the issue of care in transmitting ideas across cultures: Absolutely. Or,

with this topic, pretty absolutely. As I was teaching a theory class this

semester, I was struck by how much the  very structured nature of French

culture informs the background of such writers as Foucault and Althusser.

It seems kind of obvious to me now--that an ideology would seem more

determined and determining on the streets of Paris than those of New York

or Los Angeles, and yet students and probably many critics might assume our

""always already"" positions are equally structured. Similarly, trying to put

Derrida's early work into a context, I mentioned May 1968. But of course my

students, most in their 20s and 30s, had no memory of those days. All of

which is to say that the ""application of ideas"" from one culture to another

must always be modified by as acute an historical awareness as the

teacher/writer can muster.

Willard,

A very French syntactic move... reversing the order of your quotation and

your question...

[deleted quotation]
* is it a problem of understanding, communication of understanding,

communication of critique, cultural sensitivity or just plain diplomacy

and tactfulness? *

[deleted quotation]
The frontiers of understanding may be located differently. It does not

follow that the paths to understanding are different except perhaps in

their empirical realization. A multi-story house with a ladder in the

pueblo fashion versus a two story house with built-in stairs versus a

skyrise appartment building with an elevator : all have a vertical axis

and a special conveyance to move from one level to the other. Different

frontiers. Same understanding (vertical, level, connection). Now,

pedagogical traditions may differently stress one or the other of the

components of the gestalt. However, whatever the pedagogical stories

recounted, hunans can ""go meta"".

""failures"" in communication between two parties or ""failures"" in

comprehenison between multiple parties provide the information (like a

flock formation) which other parties can read, interpret and even on

occasion reformulate for the two or more parties to ""succeed"" (and thus

fail by moving certain components to the background of communication or

to the great cultural unconscious).

What on earth prompted such a two-solitudes dichotomous question? Why

would one automatically believe the account provided by the Ennals? Isn't

the definition of ""linguistic"" restrictive even in this context? Isn't

pragmatics a part of linguistics?  I don't get the rhetoric of ""this is

more difficult than mere X"". It seems snobbish. I prefer a hint of modesty

as in ... It's only an omlette with a touch of tarragon. Mais quel

omlette!

Time is again -- the 15th time, to be exact -- to look up from the work --

nose from off the grindstone, ear up from the ground, shoulder away from

the wheel -- and notice that we've been hanging out in this virtual here

for a while -- in the life of dogs and computers quite a while. And in the

life of humans the teens seem forever, especially to the parents. Will

Humanist make it out of its teenage years? Will I? It's been quite an

adolescence so far!

But now time to celebrate our persistence (or survival, if you wish) and

see what the horizon looks like. Refulgent with bright promise, yes, of

course, even if one cannot see ""Eternity's sunrise"", and despite the

formidable darknesses visible and invisible. But it's the present and

immediate past I want to talk about, as I think from them we may get some

direction into the future of emergent and unrealized possibilities for the

field.

Recently I attended a meeting in Pisa hosted by Antonio Zampolli (to whom

many thanks), the purpose of which was to sketch out a ""roadmap"" for the

field. Various people reported on activities in the various disciplines,

concentrating on the new and interesting in order to triangulate on the

way(s) ahead. More will come of this very productive meeting in due course,

at the forthcoming ALLC/ACH in Tuebingen. My own contribution in Pisa was

chiefly in the form of an actual map of a kind, ""a rough intellectual map

for humanities computing"" <http://ilex.cc.kcl.ac.uk/wlm/essays/map/>.

What's new about this map -- the question *was* asked -- isn't anything in

it, rather our impulse and ability to engage in this sort of activity.

Gradually over the last 10 years, as voices from outside the older

disciplines have gained confidence and been heard, the methodological

commons has come into focus, and the interchange of intellectual goods

between the disciplines and the commons taken shape. More recently (though

with great debt to earlier work) the ""clouds of knowing"", as Harold Short

called them, have become visible in relation to this commons: broad areas

Dear colleagues,

Origins and ends provide for interesting meditations and the telling of

stories tall enough to exceed measure. As a poet friend of mine once wrote

about a flight of crows,
[deleted quotation]
In all their mythological contingencies still these stories are what give

some shape and sense of purpose to the muddle in the middle. Which is where

we are. And that, perhaps, is one reason we celebrate birthdays and

other  anniversaries (""turns of the year"") -- to take our bearings from

where we think we have come and from where we desire (or perhaps fear) to

go. I won't tell the story of Humanist's beginnings, which by now has

become a story charged with far more significance for me than whatever

might have actually happened at the time.

But to the point. Humanist has just turned 16, a very sweet 16 in my book

of life, and accordingly I send you warmest greetings on this cool late

evening in London. As for the ""never having been kissed"" which this

sweetness of 16 proverbially, quaintly evokes -- I shudder to think what

age a modern version of this statement would specify -- we can relax at

Humanist's constant kissing and being kissed, by the joy as it flies, from

day 1 of its virtual existence. No chasing this one out of the village with

hooting and rock-throwing. If only Athena were not such a hard, martial

character, the story of her birth would be a useful one here. So allow me

to rewrite that story of origins, being orientated as I am, with Aphrodite

in her stead. (You may, of course, prefer a luscious Apollo or a tender

Hyacinthus, or even a Gladiator.)

One must blow the whistle on anthropomorphizing, yet late adolescence seems

just about right for the field Humanist grazes in (enter cow-eyed Hera,

without the jealous fits, and no philandering husband). Thanks at the

moment mostly to the Canadians, it seems, we can point to junior and senior

academic positions that have recently been filled or are currently being

advertised. We can point to a robust, healthy relationship between the

academic and the non-/semi-academic sides of the equation. The collegial

intermingling of humanities computing with computer science, with

mathematics and with the history and philosophy of the natural sciences is

very encouraging indeed. And all the other disciplinary kinships by means

of which we are acquiring wisdom and stature.

I certainly would not want to blink at the brutalities of the job market

and various other challenges that may strengthen one's character but don't

allow for the kind of intellectual growing we so desparately need from all

the arising talent. Nor would I want to be understood as making light of

the severe intellectual and social challenges that our interdiscipline by

nature faces. But the vigour of the field seems to me unmistakable in the

rapid growth of things to do, books to read, neighbouring disciplines to

explore, friends in them to make.

But the witching hour (by British Summer Time) is upon me, so I bid you

goodnight with the Happy Birthday and look forward to a long life of

conversation to come.

This is a quick reminder about this year's ACH Jobs mentoring services. If

you work with graduate students or run a humanities computing training

program, please feel free to this information along to your students, even

if they won't be attending ACH-ALLC this year.

The ACH will be offering mentoring services again this year at ACH-ALLC

2003. The goal of the mentoring program is to help people get their

bearings within the humanities computing job market. Whether you are a

graduate student, a recent graduate, someone changing fields or or jobs, or

just thinking of doing so, mentoring can help you learn more about the jobs

that are out there and what training and experience they require. It can

also give you a more personal perspective on humanities computing jobs,

careers, and research. Sign up for a mentor now (see below), or stop by the

ACH Jobs poster session for an informal chat.

In addition to the conference mentoring, ACH offers year-round mentoring

services, matching those who want advice with those who can provide it.

To sign up to meet with a mentor at ACH-ALLC 2003, or to request a

mentoring contact during the year, please send email to

This is, of course, a problem of flective languages (with relatively free

Croatian, Greek...). As far as I know, there is some research into parsers

for Latin (Italian LEMLAT project, Portuguese OLISSIPO project--both

traceable on the WWW), but it seems yet to linger on purely academic level

(restricted to certain word types, or to certain text groups--in any case,

nothing readily available for us end-users).

However, this seems related to the _consumptive humanities_ theme. If I

want to parse, or to tag parts of speech in a Latin text, or texts--do I

build a parser first, or do I do it the _old-fashioned_ way, relying on

human linguistic intelligence? The first way has an obvious advantage--when

I build the parser, with necessary adaptations, I sell it to any and all

who need to parse / spellcheck any flective language, and get quite

comfortably rich (so I can even devote the rest of my life to purely

academic classical philology).

- A Complete and Comprehensive System for Modern Greek Language

Processing Proposed as a Modern Greek Language Call Method Developer

S. D. Baldzis, E. Eumeridou and S.A. Kolalas

pp. 373-400

In this paper, we put forward a fully developed system for the teaching

of Modern Greek Language (MGL). The system comprises a parser and

generator for Modern Greek sentences as well as a computational lexicon,

encoding morphological, syntactic, and semantic information for words.

In this paper, we present the major components of the system,

highlighting their suitability for the teaching of MGL in an

experimental, open, and cooperative educational environment. The

proposed system can be used either in a classroom environment or by

Internet correspondence for the teaching of MGL as a native or foreign

language.

- Automatically Categorizing Written Texts by Author Gender

Moshe Koppel, Shlomo Argamon and Anat Rachel Shimoni

pp. 401-412

The problem of automatically determining the gender of a document's

author would appear to be a more subtle problem than those of

categorization by topic or authorship attribution. Nevertheless, it is

shown that automated text categorization techniques can exploit

combinations of simple lexical and syntactic features to infer the

gender of the author of an unseen formal written document with

approximately 80 per cent accuracy. The same techniques can be used to

determine if a document is fiction or non-fiction with approximately 98

per cent accuracy.

pp. 413-426

A conceptual glossary is a textual reference work that combines the

features of a thesaurus and an index verborum. In it, the word

occurrences within a given text are classified, disambiguated, and

indexed according to their membership of a set of conceptual (i.e.

semantic) fields. Since 1994, we have been working towards building a

set of conceptual glossaries for the Latin Vulgate Bible. So far, we

have published a conceptual glossary to the Gospel according to John and

are at present completing the analysis of the",Converted_Text,2003-2004,,,,

In Mark Haddons The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time

(Vintage, 2004), the protagonist and narrator, a brilliant teenage boy with

Aspergers Syndrome, observes that Prime numbers are what is left when you

have taken all the patterns away. I think prime numbers are like life, he

says. They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even

if you spent all of your time thinking about them. (p. 15) Today the prime

number in question is 17 ­ the number of years Humanist has been in

existence. I do not mean to imply anything magical about the ambiguous fact

of Humanists age ­ 17 years old but in its 18th year, and in its 17th year

last year. But the idea of patterns beyond our ability to specify them is

central to what we do, and a prime-numbered birthday is as good an occasion

as any to notice the fact.

Making the question of what might be central to our practice mathematical

is also a good way to mark another step in a coming of age. As a science of

pure form without content ­ was it Russell who said that mathematics is not

*about* anything at all? ­ mathematics requires an extraordinary ability to

think in the abstract that I, for one, do not possess. But mathematics is

(as mathematicans are wont to say) beautiful, and more importantly for

us, computation is deeply rooted in mathematical questions. So, sooner or

later a computing humanist wanting to stand on solid granite needs to look

into the matter, or so recently I have been telling myself. This is not to

advocate a mystical foundationalism, rather to respect and discover one of

the two main strands of computations history. It is to strive for a better

answer to the question, where are we from, and what is it like there?

But the mathematical, arithmetic reality that Humanist faces on this

birthday is the brutal fact of the daily number of unwanted, polluting

messages in the data-stream where it swims. Throughout its history members

of Humanist have from time to time complained of infoglut, beginning

approximately 1 month after the first message was sent out, when the medium

was so new we all took it as imperative that each message be meaningful. On

each occasion the rising tide provoked an innovation (Humanist's digesting

was one of these) or exhortations to adjust. This time the (mis)infoglut

is, obviously, beyond our ability to control, at least not satisfactorily.

I have to assure people repeatedly that if a message goes astray, if they

don't hear from me, it's highly unlikely to be because I've decided to

ignore them, most likely that their messages have bee dragged down by

obscene offers and promises from people I would never care to meet. Be that

as it may, the problem for Humanist is the problem of carrying on a

conversation against such a cacaphony.

Permit me the perhaps unwarranted conclusion that our 17 years together

attests to the value we place in this long conversation, which is as far as

I am concerned what humanities computing in the end amounts to. The term

""lone scholar"" is these days almost a term of contempt, just as

""collaboration"" is so often held up as an unquestioned (and opposite)

virtue, so often without the virtue-holder-upper having much of an idea

what collaboration is about, when it is *really* collaboration and not just

getting other people to do what you don't want to do yourself. Humanists

have seldom if ever been unengaged in a slow, stately conversation that is

in fact collaborative. The sociological history of knowledge teaches us

that. Everything we do is for and with others, even if we hardly ever see

them. But, yes, there are aspects of this normal working together that the

digital medium gives us the chance to do better. Central to that is

conversation -- saying things so that we may come to know, true things if

we can, of course, but more importantly, truth-tending things. That's what

Humanist has always been about, if I am not badly mistaken. About learning

by taking risks, like how to ride a bicycle.

We're always worrying ourselves about whether humanities computing has made

its mark in the world and on the world. It seems to me, however, that quiet

change, though harder to detect, is sometimes much better and more powerful

in its effects than the noisy, obviously mark-making, position-taking kind.

If during these 17 years Humanist has contributed to the world, it has done

so very quietly by nature, like conversation, leaving hardly a trace. It's

like teaching, whose real effects are impossible to measure and which

requires considerable faith to continue doing, and so must be done for the

love of it if the effects are to be good. ""Do what you do only out of

love."" Just so.

Yours,

With generous support from Northwestern University's Office of Research and

Office of Information Technology, and from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation,

the American Council of Learned Societies' Commission on

Cyberinfrastructure for Hmanities and Social Sciences will hold its second

public hearing in Evanston, Illinois, on Saturday, May 22nd, 2004.  The

meeting will be held from 10 am until 1 pm, in the Allen Center on the

campus of Northwestern University.  Maps of the campus are online at

http://www.northwestern.edu/campus/maps.html.  The meeting is open to the

public.  The closest hotel is the Hilton Garden Inn Hotel, in

Evanston.  For more hotel information, see:

O'Hare airport is the closest air terminal.  A cab ride from O'Hare to the

Evanston campus of Northwestern is about $24.

In January, 2003, the National Science Foundation issued a report

recommending significant changes to support greatly enhanced

cyberinfrastructure to support  research in science and engineering

(http://www.communitytechnology.org/nsf_ci_report/).

The current ACLS commission is charged with identifying and articulating

similar challenges and solutions for the humanities and social sciences,

and they will be working on the following elements of their charge

throughout this year:

     * Describe and analyze the current state of humanities and social

       science cyberinfrastructure

     * Articulate the requirements and the potential contributions of the

       humanities and the social sciences in developing a

       cyberinfrastructure for information, teaching, and research

     * Recommend areas of emphasis and coordination for the various

       agencies and institutions, public and private, that contribute to

       the development of this cyberinfrastructure

Not sure if this fits your bill, but Erowid -- the largest online

repository of information on psychoactives of all kinds -- does have a

Smart Drugs vault.  Their definition of what a smart drug is may differ

from yours, but they're worth a look.

Each substance has a vault; the information in that vault will almost

definitely be partly techhnical, but will contain anything they've been

able to find, including submitted experience reports from people taking it,

X-Humanist: Vol. 19 Num. 1 (1)

It is no coincidence that at the same time of year we find ourselves
talking about mentoring, about gathering together in splendid,
spectacularly beautiful locations (such as Victoria, British Columbia -- be
there or square) and about celebrating Humanist's birthday. Eighteen today!
The chronological connection is made by the conference (in 1987, in
Columbia, South Carolina, the air then heavy with the intoxicating perfume
of flowers) at which inspiration for Humanist came, in a meeting of
disaffected support people, marginalized assistant professors and, as I
recall, one senior academic. Many lives have changed radically since then,
mine included. Some lives of great importance to us have ended in this time
-- Elaine Nardocchio, Don Fowler, Paul Evan Peters and Antonio Zampolli
come immediately to mind. But so much has improved.
The Canadians (whose leadership comes as no surprise to one who lived among
them for 20 years) are in process of appointing worthy people to positions
actually in humanities computing, some at a senior level. In Italy much is
continuing to happen in what can be regarded, if you limit computing to
machines of the Turing and von Neumann sort, as the oldest tradition we
have. In Australia there have been at least two international conferences
in the subject, the second much larger and more diverse than the first. My
own department has grown by leaps and bounds, now has MA and PhD programmes
and shows every sign of getting ready to leap again. There is now a
Blackwell's Companion to refer people to, a book series in the making, some
books (including my own) just about to emerge and a very impressive
professional journal whose only problem is too many competent submissions.
There is even, as will be announced here shortly, a Text Analysis Summit
about to be held. Imagine.
So, we can say that it feels very good to be 18.
Some academic groupings, though much larger and better funded, have
sterner, less companionable gatherings and altogether less welcoming
professional relations. In a recent number of Humanist, Stephen Ramsay
noted that not a bad word about the ACH mentoring programme has been heard
since it began. Perhaps he chose this mode of expression for the same
reason that a healthy, happy person will reply to the question, ""How are
you?"" by saying ""Not bad!"", rather than ""Wonderful!"" -- so as not to tempt
fate. In any case, he puts before us an accurate picture of how welcoming
and helpful the loose community of people in humanities computing actually
are. Reports from those who have been mentored attest to those qualities,
and some have themselves subsequently volunteered for the programme as a
result. Recently one of them, whom I had mentored, wrote to me asking if I
would contribute to the programme again. I said yes, delighted to see that
she had moved from being a mentee to someone organizing mentors in less
than two years.
The question is, I suppose -- you know me, there's always going to be a
question somewhere -- what do we do with the strength, vigour and good
reputation the last 18 years has seen us give ourselves? Where is the
central contribution to be made -- that is, the one to which we all need to
be contributing, whatever our private inclinations and talents?
This, it seems to me, is toward a much better understanding of how we all
fit together and work together. How we all converse, more often, more
effectively, with greater self-awareness. How we understand what we do *as*
conversing. Of course we need to have things to say that are worth saying,
but that's largely up to us individually. What's not is how saying becomes
conversing.
Perhaps, as editor of Humanist, it's entirely predictable that I would
advocate asking how we can use what we've now got, to its best capacities,
to help make the transition between saying and conversing. Not an easy one
to make because of the risks involved in being open enough about the real
questions that responses, some of them perhaps vehement, actually come. But
sholars in the humanities write books, publish articles and give lectures
in order to communicate, yes? Designers and builders of systems in
humanities computing make intellectual tools for the same purpose, right?
-- to communicate, one might say, ways of thinking-by-doing. Otherwise,
rather than conversations on the air, we will find ourselves having turned
what is new into yet another way of advancing that which is definitive,
monumental and most assuredly has an IMPACT -- which, to me, sounds like a
cross between a bowling alley and a graveyard. Not for me and, I suspect,
not for you either.
So, on this 18th birthday, I offer congratulations to us all and best
wishes for an even more riskily talkative 19th year.
Yours,
WM

I thought Humanist subscribers might be interested in these brief
bios of the five digital library fellows who will be attending the
Graduate School of Library and Information Science at the University
of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, next year.  The bios demonstrate, I
think, some of the connections between humanities computing and
library and information science, particularly around digital
libraries. The fellowships are funded as part of a $939,618 grant
from the Institute for Museum and Library Services to Indiana
University and the University of Illinois ""to create the first
research-based, comprehensive master's-level and post-master's in
library science (MLS) degree to educate librarians for work in
digital library programs. New internships in digital library projects
will be added to libraries at both institutions, and post-MLS
enrollees will be required to complete an internship.""
A web site for the project can be found at:
http://lair.indiana.edu/research/dlib/
Bios:
Shane Beers of Cincinnati, Ohio will be pursuing the M.S. with an
emphasis on digital libraries.  He earned a Bachelor of Science in
Design in 2003 from the University of Cincinnati College of Design,
Architecture, Art, and Planning and has worked as a graphic designer
for Catt Lyon Design and Wayfinding Consultants in Cincinnati, where
he has acted as a multi-purpose designer, utilizing skills in 2-D, 3- D,
and environmental design.  He has also been involved in web design
projects for PJA/ULTRA in Boston and Warner Bros. Online in New
York.  He is particularly interested in digital archiving and public
access to these archives.
Parmit Chilana of Surrey, British Columbia will be pursuing the M.S.
with an emphasis on digital libraries.  She completed a BSc in
Computing Science from Simon Fraser University (SFU) in 2005.  She
has worked as a Youth_at_BC Internet/Computer Trainer at the Surrey
Public Library and as a bioinformatics software developer in the
Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry at SFU.  She has
been active in the Women in Computing Science Society at SFU.  She is
particularly interested in interface design.
Howard Ding will be returning to UIUC from New York to pursue the
M.S. with an emphasis on digital libraries.  He earned B.S. degrees
in physics and mathematics summa cum laude from UIUC in 1992.  He
subsequently earned an M.S. in mathematics from the State University
of New York at Stony Brook.  For the past few years he has been
employed by Sabre II Trading/Ovis Corporation as the sole information
technology specialist, responsible for implementing and maintaining a
system to search large amounts of equity options data to assist
traders in finding profitable trades.  He finds the interdisciplinary
nature of library and information science particularly attractive.
Brian Franklin will be pursuing the M.S. with an emphasis on digital
libraries.  He earned a B.A. in English and History from UIUC in 1998
and has considerable experience in production management in
publishing, encompassing print production, web design, and database
building and maintenance for both a company and a professional
society in Chicago.  He also worked as a collection management

Today, 7 May 2006, Humanist completes its 19th year and begins its 20th.
By automatic count there are 1446 subscriptions, up 63 from last year at
about this time, and a few less messages -- we are getting more to the
point? For some years Humanist has been in a steady state and, being
somewhat of a social institution, would seem to have a good chance of
stability for a long time to come. In recognition of its primary
function over the last many years, no longer so much of a revolutionary
banner as a social bonding agent, I've changed its epigraph, as follows.
Formerly the homepage quoted Colin Cherry's stirring remark,
[deleted quotation]Now that we are the first of those future generations, and so share that
""commonplace experience"", it's time, I thought, to draw attention to its
vital force, calling on Benedict Anderson and Robert Asen to articulate
what might otherwise go unnoticed, though no less constitutive:
[deleted quotation]We know from your messages that change in the field continues apace,
however. To point to one kind of evidence for positive development, this
Humanist-year there have been more jobs in humanities computing
advertised here, and more explicitly academic jobs, than ever before --
most recently an endowed chair (at Dartmouth -- may it be well filled).
It seems likely that this trend will continue. To point to another
positive sign, we now have at long last a peer-reviewed online journal,
the Digital Humanities Quarterly, and an umbrella organization, the
Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations, www.digitalhumanities.org,
to cover all our activities world-wide.
What, then, is on the event-horizon for us?
As many here will recall, I've recently asked about the relationship
between humanities computing and computer science. Although the
manifestations of such a relationship are badly under-theorized from the
perspective of the humanities, the growing number of true collaborations
between HC practitioners and CS people is highly significant, as is the
demonstrable increase in published discussions, speculative reports and
conferences, symposia and meetings within the last few years, though
most of them have been more wishful than incisive. By my undoubtedly
incomplete catalogue, omitting the few article-length writings, these
are as follows: 1990 (1), 1992 (1), 1997/8 (1), 1999 (1), 2003 (2),
2005(1), 2006 (3). It is still true, and will remain so, that many
invididuals will not be able to see that such collaboration is even
possible -- I was told by one senior computer scientist recently that it
was unthinkable. Perhaps so, but it is happening. Partly the cause for
interest from CS may be declining enrolments in that discipline and its
maturation to the point at which tackling real problems in the
humanities has become feasible. On our side we also have matured to the
point of being able to realise that our theoretical ideas are bent out
of shape if not inhibited by the assumptions embedded in commonplace
tools -- and, especially, in their data models and system designs. (A
few of us have been saying this for years, I know.) What I as a
researcher need, for example, lies midway between relational database
design and text-encoding; for the moment I am siding with the former,
but the work I am doing needs technical rethinking in a way I do not
know how to do.
My question has another aspect to it that also lies on our
event-horizon, something I already mentioned in passing: the theorizing
of current activity. The basics seem clear enough to me, presuming the
standard story of CS and the traditional view of humanities scholarship.
But practice has a way of surprising us, especially computing practice,
at least partly because the methodological perspective reveals
disciplinary friends among strangers, and these friends require some
adjustment on our part, more than a little expansion of our field of
vision. Here the problem extends way beyond the involvement with CS to
all interdisciplinary involvements. In labs, offices, seminar rooms and
so forth, even as I write, mostly unobserved collaborations are
happening -- mostly unobserved because in the heat of the moment, with
an eye to results, what's happening doesn't seem important enough in
itself, and there's the rub. It is clear to me from the lab notebooks
that my students have started keeping that were a record kept and
analyzed as a standard part of our practice, we'd be quite a bit wiser
than we are now. Social scientists with a knowledge of computing are
needed. Numerous PhD dissertations are waiting to be written on the
basis of participant-observations. Very good training for them, I would
think. Very valuable meta-results for us.
Part of the theorizing of practice involves our relationship to the
older humanities over the question of method. It's easy to conclude that
method (by which we tend to mean algorithmic procedure) is our friend,
and to note the traditional antipathy of the humanities to method, as
discussed for example by Gadamer in Truth and Method. But the apparently
tidy picture gets messy when one looks into the details: like all other
disciplinary terms I've examined, ""method"" is relative to the style of
reasoning, and that is an historical as well as local phenomenon. (See,
for example, Coleridge's Treatise on Method and Descartes' Discourse.)
I'd think that figuring out how a discipline is methodical is a first
step toward constructing a productive relationship between computing and
any discipline. Hence philological studies of more disciplinary terms
are in= order.
Speaking of PhD students, we at King's College London started a PhD
programme in the Autumn of the current academic year. Without
publicizing the degree until the last minute, when we were allowed to
advertise for a studentship, we've gained a fair number of applicants,
and with them the intriguing problem of what, exactly, a PhD in
humanities computing (or in the digital humanities) might be. We're in
the process of figuring that out, but it does seem highly likely that
the norm will be something like a collaborative degree with at least one
other department, with of course humanities computing playing the major
role. If it is to do so, as here at King's, then I'd think that a
practical component to the PhD is a requirement, as I'm starting to
insist. It isn't obvious what positions PhD students in the digital
humanities are training for, but I point again to the increase in the
number of jobs and to the chicken-and-egg dilemma that must be avoided
by some judicious risk-taking. One wonders what will happen to the field
when in years hence it is populated by those holding such degrees.
There are undoubtedly other things on that horizon, but I'll stop here
with my speculations on them. In a little over a week's time I head off
to New York to receive the Lyman Award, and once again I am surprised
and delighted at the attention to Humanist -- a great collaborative
phenomenon if ever there was one. The occasion demands reflection on the
past, my past in particular. Forgive me for attempting here to draw an
historical lesson or two from what seemed at the time more or less a
Brownian motion of random events and circumstances. Looking at one
thing, seeing another -- can we make meaning out of the world in any
other way? What I see, peering into the murk of just-happenings and
trying very hard to speak with unforked tongue, is that Humanist is just
about the only professional thing I've done from which I never expected
reward. I wasn't and isn't that I don't like rewards. Rather because
Humanist is unrefereed, self-published and very demotic, it never seemed
the sort of thing anyone important would pay any attention to. And I've
also never been able to ignore the fact that doing Humanist is its own
reward. Yet again, nevertheless and quite unexpectedly, it motivates a
giving. Full of hope I conclude that the great principle of reprocity
actually works: do ut des, I give that you may give. I also take delight
in the fact that DO UT DES is the name of a Tuscan wine.
All the best to all of you starting into Humanist's 20th year!

Symposium Announcement:
The Computer:  The Once and Future Medium for the Social Sciences and the
Humanities
http://www.brocku.ca/computingsymposium
The computer is offering important new possibilities for scholars.
Heightened processing power, new categories of software, and, indeed, novel
conceptions of computing are offering scholars opportunities to analyze,
express and instruct in ways unimaginable even in the early 1990s.
Some human science researchers know this.  We believe more should.   For
this reason, the Canadian Committee for History and Computing and the
Society for Digital Humanities are pleased to announce their joint
sponsorship of the symposium The Computer:  The Once and Future Medium for
the Social Sciences and the Humanities.  The purpose of the symposium will
be to introduce scholars to a wide array of new technologies and approaches,
with non-technical papers on topics ranging from the use of virtual reality
to construct model sites in ancient Rome to the use of simulations to plan
for pandemics and the use of software to model the impact that emotion plays
in individual and group decision making.
The symposium will be convened 8:30 a.m. on May 30th, 2006 at York

X-Humanist: Vol. 21 Num. 1 (1)

In their recent book, INEQUALITY.COM, Kieron O'Hara and David Stevens
have argued that the great revolutionary dream of the Internet's
democratization of the world turns out to be quite a mixed bag. On the
one hand, as Jon Garvie says in his summarizing review of their
argument, ""Will the digital age bring equality?"" (TLS 2 May 2007),
""the distribution of the power to create and store information online
has not been been matched by reduced inequality in the world at
large"". Where the Internet is now a daily fact of life, there is in
fact an argument that quite the opposite has happened. ""In a clever
reading of Marshall McLuhan,"" Garvie notes,
[deleted quotation]On the other hand, the Internet,
[deleted quotation]The closer one looks, the more the uncertainties, and not much we can
do about them directly. Toward the end of the review, however, Garvie
voices criticism which points to what we can do and in fact are doing:
[deleted quotation]Collaboration is a fine thing, but merely working together is not
enough, as the metaphor suggests in its depiction of a person's
imagined spatial entrapment within his or her surrounding sphere,
which seems all the world, but isn't. Building a common perspective
on computing -- or better, a shared way of gaining perspectives -- is
the state of maturity we've been growing ourselves into for more than
the last 20 years of Humanist's being-in-the-world, which I celebrate
today. I like to compare our socio-intellectual place to a sea-going
explorer's, on board a methodological vessel in an archipelago of
disciplines. Northrop Frye, combining the ancient definition of God
as ""centre everywhere,  circumference nowhere"" (""centrum ubique,
circumferentia nusquam"") with Blake's metaphor of ""expanding eyes"",
spoke of one's own discipline-of-origin as a centre of all knowledge
that expands into all others. The key is the expanding.
I tried some of this the other day IN PUBLIC. A philosophically
inclined historian I know was giving a talk at a high-powered
specialist centre in a nearby institution, so I went to hear  him.
His talk was very good, very stimulating -- no surprise, he's
first-rate. Stimulated thereby I ventured during the question
period afterwards to connect his call for more adventurous ways of
talking about his subject to some of the more adventurous reading I
have been doing, reading well outside the discipline represented by
the specialist centre. By the sucking in of breath among the others
in the small audience and by the momentary look of panic on his face
I knew immediately that the collective disciplinary immune system had
detected invasive ideas and was immediately responding. I knew at
once that I was suddenly in the role of the talkative casually
dressed grey-bearded barking-mad nutter whom all speakers fear. Now I
was not citing reports of crop-circles, or intercourse with
extraterrestrials (cf. http://www.billymeier.com/billy_meier.htm),
rather arguments made by anthropological linguists about jazz
improvisation, and other arguments by theoretical biologists about
self-organizing systems. In other words, what triggered the immune
response was the gesture of expanding. What really did it, I think,
was the word ""jazz"". I mean, theoretical biology is a science, and we
gotta respect THE TRUTH, right? But jazz???? According to Lafcadio
Hearn, summarizing the consensus of opinion among (white)
musicologists in 1912, the word began as *jass*,
[deleted quotation]There are problems with Hearn's etymology. The OED, more cautious
and sober, notes ""Origin unknown"". More interestingly, however, the
language of the context from which I've extracted this quotation is
racially polarized (e.g. ""to produce the same effect in whites the further
stimulation of alcohol is needed""), suggesting that in all probability
the musicologists of the time went for a particular meaning with
conditioned alacrity -- and thereby blocked from musicological sight
for many decades aspects of jazz we have only begun to understand
fairly recently. (See e.g. Paul Berliner's magnificent Thinking in Jazz:
The Infinite Art of Improvisation, Chicago 1994.) But whatever may
be the case,  the subterranean connotations of the word retain the
power to expand the mind to the point of discomfort and stress.
But I digress.
Of course one needs to do all one can to keep from exploding, or
expanding to the point of ineffectual dissolution, or acquiring books
the reading of which demands more time than one has in the probable
remainder of one's life. One needs focus. But that does not mean
myopia or the tunnel-vision of the stiff-necked, space-cramped coal
miner, who sees sharply only what's immediately within the brightly
illuminated spot of his headlight.
These 20 years of Humanist have for its ringmaster been dedicated
not just to an expanding field of vision but to working out the
implications of the operative participle of our practice, to
""expanding eyes"".
Evidence of a good result, from this and other efforts, is not just
devoutly to be wished for. It is to be found e.g. in the recent book, Mind
Technologies: Humanities Computing and the Canadian Academic
Community (Calgary, 2006), ed. Ray Siemens and David Moorman. (Read
it tonight.) I cite but a few examples, with no surprise that they
are Canadian.
In a delightful chapter, ""Forswearing Thin Potations: The Creation of
Rich Texts Online"", Michael Best (Professor Emeritus, Victoria,
http://www.engl.uvic.ca/Faculty/MBHomePage/) begins by invoking
Falstaff's declaration that, ""If I had a thousand sonnes, the first
humane principle I would teach them, should be, to forsweare thin
potations, and to addict themselues to sacke"". He pulls out of
Falstaff's typically corrupting inclination the wherewithal to voice
""my conviction that the way ahead for Humanities Computing lies in
taking the initiative, forswearing the thin potations consumed by
those who would have us conform to the pale demands of tradition"" (p.
1). While recognizing our duty to preserve our inheritances, he goes
on to say, ""I think it not an understatement to claim that there is a
powerful pressure of tradition in academia generally to be safe, to
progress through accepted and understood channels, to publish in
accepted journals and presses, to take no risks as one aspires to
tenure, promotion, and the small carrots of prestige and salary
increments that the profession offers"" (p. 2). Be adventurous!
(When you can.)
At the other end of the volume, Andrew Mactavish and Geoffrey
Rockwell examine the distrust which still characterizes reactions to
computing in the humanities and find in it some complex questions
about the relation between the humanities and technology. They
examine historically as well as philosophically basic assumptions of
the humanities, asking how these are challenged by the legitimization
of technical practice (p. 229). In the Afterword, on the Canadian
TAPoR project (http://tapor1.mcmaster.ca/home.html), Rockwell asks,
what are the interesting questions of humanities computing? Are they
new? He argues that development of tools arises from craft theory as
well as generates it. But this theory is rarely articulated by the
people who develop the tools, except insofar as the tool is itself an
articulation. (In what sense can this be?) For me what jumped off the
page is his statement that craft theories ""come to light when we have
a sufficient number of competing tools that others need to articulate
why one would use one tool over another"" (pp. 294f). Indeed -- take
text-analysis and relational database design as our prime example.
Tools are not only part of the interpretative object, he writes, they
are part of the interpretative possibilities of a text, for all texts
are embedded within or manifested by tools that authorize or make
difficult different types of interpretation. What changes, or could
change, when we use what tool?
A field in which questions of this sort can be asked, and are asked,
has come of age in an important way. Yes, so much remains to be done
-- more accurately, appears on the horizon as we approach it. We
feel, or at least I feel, so adolescent in clumsiness and so
possessed by an ignorance that compelled to speak comes out ofttimes
as arrogance. But now is no time to be a wall-flower drinking thin
potations, if any at all, under the strict gaze of sophisticated
parental traditions. Play-time. Jazz-time.
Reach for the strong stuff and drink to Humanist's continued health!

Dear colleagues,
The transition across volumes, from 20 (for the 19th year) to 21 (for
the 20th, just celebrated) was less than perfect this time, because I
didn't think to warn my technical colleague at Virginia of the
upcoming transition. And, as it happened, the software went wonky at
precisely the wrong time, so there were further delays. Hence the
great mass of messages, many of them rather late, now about to descend on you.
My apologies.
Yours,

         From: Martin Mueller 
         Subject: Re: 21.541 ""anywhere you want to go""

In thinking about the computer as a kind of automobile,  Willard
raises the troubling question ""What happens to a city whose urban
planners think only in terms of the automobile?""  A good question from
the pedestrian's or cyclist's perspective.  But let's be fair to
automobiles, trains, and planes:  if one of your great pleasures in
life is hiking in the mountains (as it true of me),  how do you get to
wherever you want to hike in the first place?

A major minor character in Thomas Mann's Magic Mountain (1923)  is the
train that brings people to the then still rather sleepy Davos. A lot
of hiking and cycling depends on other modes of transportation. The
application to humanities computing is obvious--or not so obvious. I
think there are two major factors that stand in the way of the
intelligent and imaginative use of information technology in the
humanities.  The first of these is the myth, encouraged by consumer
oriented applications of technology, that you can interesting
scholarly things by pushing some combination of buttons, and that if
you can't learn to push those buttons in five minutes, it isn't worth
doing or the program sucks. The second is the humanist's fear that the
technology will take over and replace treasured forms of human(e)
inquiry.  But think of the new, strenuous, and pleasurable forms of
hiking or skiing that are enabled by technology. Switzerland is after
all a triumph of civil engineering. And if one thinks of the
humanities as a kind of Switzerland, perhaps it points to productive
ways of seeing the interaction of man and machine (I am aware of
aspects of Switzerland where the humanities perhaps do not want to go)

         From: Willard McCarty 
         Subject: the 21st time around the Maypole

Today is Humanist's 21st birthday! Some of you 
have been around since the very beginning, many 
for many years. So most everyone here knows that 
on 7 May every year I post a HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
message, taking a bit of time out not just to 
celebrate longevity but also to reflect on 
Humanist's conceptual wanderings during the year.

This time allow me to do these things by drawing 
your attention to four bits of writing, whose 
conjunction to my mind sums up what this 
whatever-it-is has been about since it began, in 
1987, when the humanities were nearing the end of 
their palaeo-electronic age. I come to the 
following construction because the necessarily 
extra-/inter-disciplinary position of humanities 
computing gives us quite a balancing act to 
perform, help with which is never superfluous. To 
put this another way, it is useful if not vital 
for us to be reminded that being in play rather 
than at rest, or in still another way, remaining 
in conversation rather than at the conclusion of 
whatever argument (or worse, persuaded by 
whatever sales-pitch), is the trick perpetually 
to be performed. We need our wakeup calls. So I give you the following:

(1) The first three paragraphs in the Preface to 
Erwin Schrödinger, What is Life? (1943), in which 
he states his excuse for venturing beyond his 
area of specialization (theoretical physics, that is):

 >A scientist is supposed to have a complete and
 >thorough knowledge, at first hand, of some
 >subjects and, therefore, is usually expected not
 >to write on any topic of which he is not a
 >master. This is regarded as a matter of noblesse
 >oblige. For the present purpose I beg to
 >renounce the noblesse, if any, and to be freed
 >of the ensuing obligation. My excuse is as follows:
 >
 >We have inherited from our forefathers the keen
 >longing for unified, all-embracing knowledge.
 >The very name given to the highest institutions
 >of learning reminds us, that from antiquity and
 >throughout many centuries the universal aspect
 >has been the only one to be given full credit.
 >But the spread, both in width and depth, of the
 >multifarious branches of knowledge during the
 >last hundred odd years has confronted us with a
 >queer dilemma. We feel clearly that we are only
 >now beginning to acquire reliable material for
 >welding together the sum total of all that is
 >known into a whole; but, on the other hand, it
 >has become next to impossible for a single mind
 >fully to command more than a small specialized version of it.
 >
 >I can see no other escape from this dilemma
 >(lest our true aim be lost forever) than that
 >some of us should venture to embark on a
 >synthesis of facts and theories, albeit with
 >second-hand and incomplete knowledge of some of
 >them -- and at the risk of making fools of ourselves.

(2) John Ziman, ""Emerging out of nature into 
history: the plurality of the sciences"", in 
Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, 
London 361 (2003): 1617-33, of which here I give 
the abstract (the whole thing is in JSTOR):

 >The idea of a 'theory of everything' is
 >inconsistent with a natural feature of
 >biological evolution: the spontaneous emergence
 >of composite entities with completely new
 >properties. At successively higher levels of
 >complexity, from elementary particles and
 >chemical molecules, through unicellular and
 >multicellular organisms, to self-aware human
 >beings and their cultural institutions, we find
 >systems obeying entirely novel principles. The
 >behaviour of such systems is not predictable
 >from the properties of their constituents, so
 >distinct 'languages' are required to describe
 >them scientifically. The plurality of our
 >sciences is thus an irreducible feature of the
 >universe we live in. In particular, the
 >reversible time coordinate of mathematical
 >physics cannot cope with the natural 'path
 >dependence' of biology. In the human sciences
 >this extends into the imagined future as well as
 >the remembered past. Furthermore, science
 >nowadays usually arises in localized social
 >contexts, where the 'logic of the situation' is
 >continually being transformed by the emergence
 >of cultural novelties such as unpredictable
 >technological innovations. Thus, scientific
 >knowledge cannot be restricted to generalized
 >synchronic models, but involves historical
 >narratives of specific events and unforeseen circumstances.

(3) G. R. Lloyd, Cognitive Variations: 
Reflections on the Unity and Diversity of the 
Human Mind (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 2007), of 
which I will quote the first paragraph from the Preface:

 >had, over many year",Current,,vol22,,,

        From: Willard McCarty 
        Subject: Happy 22nd Birthday!

If a dog seems to live 7 times faster than a human, how fast does an 
online seminar like Humanist age in our sight? How old do we Humanists 
feel? Like the 22 year-old clinging to the belief that he or she can do 
anything but beginning to suspect otherwise? Like the 154 year-old (22 * 
7 = 154) who cannot behave properly? Like an ageless sage?

A marvellous, wonderful celebration of Humanist's 21st birthday was 
staged by Lisa Lena Opas-HÃ¤nninen at DH2008 almost a year ago, at which 
not a few digital grandees were to be seen drinking liberally to its 
health. (See the post-sauna 
http://www.ekl.oulu.fi/dh2008/gallery/pages/IMG_4445.html and its 
unsteady sequels.) A few years back I recall making some claim or other 
about Humanist coming of age at 18, by which time few of its original 
members remained, many having grown too old or too busy with heavy 
matters of state to remain in this playpen of ideas and, as we say, 
information. Now we're 22. I sit here in my 109 year-old Victorian 
London house with the latest building project underway (a conservatory, 
and beautiful it will be once it is done...) marvelling at the dizzying 
speed with which Humanist's 22nd continuous year of existence has 
passed. Although it may be said that the handbasket headed for Hell 
continues its lamentable journey filled with most things we value, there 
are moments when the view (I am imagining, unaccountably, the view from 
a ski-lift or mountain-top) gives back blessings all out of proportion 
to the efforts invested in getting here. This ritual occasion, on 7 May 
every year when I send out a birthday message, allows me publically to 
notice them, or at least to notice that blessings are bestowed and then 
to let you fill in the details for yourself. And to all those (if there 
be any) who grumble objections at blessedness such as it is among 
digital humanists, I recommend Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru (1952), in which 
the perfect bureaucrat (spitting image of the one Turing used to help 
him think his way through the Entscheidungsproblem) gets up from his 
desk, shows us what's what and dies in a state of grace.

This 7th May is special for Humanist because it marks the nearly 
seamless move to digitalhumanities.org and completely successful trial 
of the new automatic mechanisms designed for it by Malgosia Askanas 
(good job indeed) and funded by the Alliance of Digital Humanities 
Organizations (to which, to whom many thanks). As one member remarked, 
the move has been unremarkable because almost completely invisible; my 
reply was, thatâs true craftsmanship. If all the gears are perfectly 
meshed, the changeover from messages numbered 22.xxx to 23.xxx today 
will have been automatic too. Previously this had to be done by hand. 
But the major improvements are those that make my life easier as editor 
in the day-to-day task of scooping up postings and posting them. What 
you observe (if that's the right word and I remain mindful of the gift) 
is a happier editor.

This 7th May is special for me professionally as being in the midst of 
my efforts to unearth the wherewithal from which, I hope, a genuine 
history of literary computing will emerge. Those who have spent much 
time in archives will know what it means to be turning up loads of 
mundane stuff, which is all to the purpose, but from time to time 
unearthing a gem. My latest gems, for example, are Edmund Callis 
Berkeley's Giant Brains, or Machines that Think (New York, John Wiley & 
Sons, 1949); Martin Mann, ""Want to Buy a Brain?"", Popular Science 
Monthly, May 1949: 148-52; a warning against such use of language for 
computers, G. R. Stibitz, ""A Note on 'Is' and 'Might Be' in Computers"", 
Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to Computation 4.31 (July): 168-9; 
and a doctoral dissertation covering the ground, David P. Julyk, ""'The 
Trouble with Machines is People.' The Computer as Icon in Post-War 
America: 1946-1970"" (Michigan, 2008). Then there's Rich Didday, Finite 
State Fantasies (Matrix, 1976), a comic book with a story, ""Escape"", 
about a teenage boy who retreats into his room, constructs a VR machine 
from a kit, hooks it to his television, builds a virtual world (an Eden, 
presumably, including a naked woman), then strips off his clothes, dives 
through the screen and flies off with her in a manner familiar to us 
from Second Life. And on the other side of the street is Walter M. 
Mathews and Kaye Reifers, ""The Computer in Cartoons: A Retrospective 
from the Saturday Review"", Communications of the ACM 27.11 (1984): 1114-9.

These are gems because they help make a history from a catalogue of 
activities and achievements. All the stuff turned up serves as a 
reminder of how much we have forgotten. The gems (yes, including the 
comic books, wacko rants, hype and techno-enthusiasms some now would 
wish permanently forgotten) are gems because they speak to the rounded 
humanity of computing humanists now old, very old or dead who did more 
than prepare concordances for print or whatever else. Theyâre gems 
because they give us clues as to why certain things happened and others 
did not. They speak to the silences in the historical record. They 
illumine certain odd statements here and there. And they eventually, I 
hope, will amount to a âhistory of the presentâ, as Foucault said, i.e. 
a history that speaks to and helps us out with our current predicaments.

Marvin Minsky said somewhere that science doesnât need history â it just 
forges ahead. Heâs a mischievous imp, and a very bright one. But Thomas 
Kuhn is, I think, more important for us at this point, esp in showing us 
what a difference an historical view of progressive disciplines can do 
for them.

Before blowing out the candles, make a wish!

Yours, with best wishes,
WM

The iSchools (http://www.ischools.org) project represents a group of 
schools committed to the idea that expertise in all forms of information 
is required for progress in science, business, education, and culture. 
This expertise includes understanding of the uses and users of 
information, and of the nature of information itself, as well as 
information technologies and their applications. 

Criteria for being recognized as an iSchool are not rigid, but schools 
are expected to have substantial sponsored research activity (an average 
of $1 million in research expenditures per year over three years), 
engagement in educating future researchers (usually through a 
research-oriented doctoral program), and a commitment to progress in the 
information field.

        From: Willard McCarty 
        Subject: Happy 23rd Birthday!


I'm reminded of Humanist's annual birthday event these last few years by 
automatic devices, now my iPhone. Unlike the birthday of a person, who 
eventually does not want his or her age to be noted or is too busy with 
other things to be around for the celebration, Humanist exists only in 
outbursts of prose which in effect celebrate its existence these last 23 
years. For those too young or too recently among us to know, Humanist 
dates back to a moment at a conference in Columbia, South Carolina, when 
Michael Sperberg-McQueen provoked the thought in me that we all should 
talk to each other more. That's what really happened (eigentlich!), 
although what I would have said at the time was that the couple of dozen 
people at the impromptu gathering of disgruntled colleagues had a 
revolution to start, and you cannot do that without conspiratorial 
passing of messages. I suppose one could say now that many of us here 
are living the outcome of that revolution, though I'd have to admit that 
us few were not the first expression of the revolutionary impulse -- Joe 
Raben was there to remind us we had a history. As Fidel has said many, 
many times, the revolution is nothing unless it continues.

A perfect example of what Humanist is all about is to my mind Wendell 
Piez's characteristically magnanimous and insightful response yesterday 
to an outburst of mine on markup, it in turn provoked by Desmond 
Schmidt's, in a conversation on the topic stretching far enough around 
the globe to be simultaneously vernal and autumnal. I have been feeling 
(perhaps in part because of my own rather bewildering heap of birthdays, 
stretching back to the time when Fr Busa got started) that Fidel's point 
has been lost in the industrialisation of humanities computing that has 
followed in the wake of TEI's great success. I have been worrying that 
the central mission of the humanities, to make/find problems where none 
were before (how I wish we could hear the two resonances of the word 
""invent"" simultaneously!) has been forgotten within the digital 
humanities by those who have found themselves all too comfortable in the 
mind-laced straitjacket of implementing someone else's ideas. 

And then I wake up from the nightmare and find Wendell, whose 
philosophical bedside manner is better than sunshine streaming through 
the blinds. CONVERSATION, not what Donald MacCrimmon MacKay apparently, 
somewhere I cannot find, called ""competitive monologue"", but real 
conversation. I think at this point of Warren McCulloch's marvellous 
""The Fun of Failures"", Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 156.0 
(April 1969): 963-8, in which he quotes MacKay and gives us an idea of 
what a powerfully questioning mind is like. ""Teaching and learning"", 
McCulloch writes there, ""are not what Donald MacKay calls competitive 
monologue, but dialogue in which each exposes the inadequacies of his 
map of the world for his partner to complete or correct."" Isn't that 
what it's all about for our kind, however geeky, however scholarly? 
Better than collaboration, the whole point of collaboration. We make 
things, sure, but in order better to question through their anomalous 
behaviours or results.

Permit me to tell a story I have likely told several times here. One of 
the things that really got up my nose (a marvellous Britishism, no?) in 
those days when Humanist began was the widely used metaphor of the 
""clearinghouse"" of information, which was what some thought was  needed. 
I had been with my auntie many times as a lad to clearing-out sales at 
department stores, which would throw open their doors at the advertised 
hour in the morning to crowds of shoppers, who would then in a mad rush 
dive at tables where clothing on sale was piled and grab, sometimes in a 
tug-of-war, at particular items. This is what came to mind when 
""clearinghouse"" was mentioned. Wrong for all sorts of reasons, 
especially because acquisition of objects was the putative goal. I am 
guessing that what really motivated my auntie wasn't the nice frock she 
hoped to grab, or not exactly, but a mixture of some vision of life 
promised by that frock and the chance to interact with those she 
probably at the time wished would die or at least go away. Conversation 
plus the ever-elusive truth, or as Plato knew perfectly well, desire.

Which is where I always begin and end. 

Happy Birthday Humanist! And thanks to everyone here, and to everyone who has come and gone, for making these conversations possible. This certainly includes the lurkers. I note, suddenly questioning that term an interesting development chronicled in the Oxford English Dictionary, the following:

-----
LURKER

1. One who lurks or lies concealed: freq. employed as a term of abuse in early quots. lit. and fig. [quotations 1325-1870]
2.  A begging impostor; a petty thief. [quotations 1842-1973]
3. App[arently] misused for LURCHER [quotation 1440]

DRAFT ADDITIONS JULY 2001 

Chiefly Computing slang. A person who reads communications to an electronic network without actively contributing. [quotations 1984-1998]
-----

>From this I conclude that computing brings out in us a playful spirit and has overall a most civilising effect!

Thank you all!


Yours,
WM

        From: Willard McCarty 
        Subject: Humanist at 24: Chuck Bush 1948-2011


Today Humanist begins its 25th, quarter-century year. In usual and 
generously imprecise human terms, we could say that a generation has 
passed and that we're on to the next one. I certainly get that sense 
from encountering whole collections of writings on the digital 
humanities, not just published but some time ago, that I knew nothing 
about until accidentially encountering them. This at first is shocking 
because I am always on the prowl. But as my friend Harold Short remarked 
a few days ago, our divergences of ideas, views, opinions, organizations 
and everything else are signs of vigour. It's what happens to fields 
that succeed. Perhaps they go to seed, but then those seeds, some of 
them, germinate and sprout and grow. Those of us who think we have *said 
it* just have to accept that it is (because we are) a living thing which 
mutates, has babies and that argues with itself. In the latest thing I 
am writing I've been dealing with a book review that sharply levels the 
charge of disunity of opinion at a branch of our field, arguings that 
the lack of consensus is a sure sign of failure. What's got me going is 
the author's evident need to think that computing is all about coming up 
with the correct answer (which unsurprisingly he thinks should turn out 
to agree rather closely with received knowledge about the subject). 
After all, we've given the field he has put in the dock 30 or more years 
to come up with the goods, and all we get are more questions!

What's much, much more difficult to accept than our comfortably small 
subculture spinning out of our control is that with the passing of a 
generation people pass. We can say, as Gregory Bateson once did, that 
room needs to be made for the next generation, not just or even 
primarily in the physical sense. (Bateson was such a man that he may 
well have said this or thought it on his deathbed.) Ideas and their 
expressions turn into prisons needing to be torn down and remade. And so 
on and so forth. There are many other comforting thoughts which we can 
have that, I suppose, all come down to the cycle of nature in one form 
or another. ""But old age should burn and rage at close of day"". ""And I 
am dumb to tell the lover's tomb"" anything at all.

So I remember Chuck Bush, who died on 13 April, for who he was. As far 
as I can recall he was there, at the International Conference on 
Computing in the Humanities (ICCH) in 1987, in Columbia, South Carolina, 
when I started in the then small community and after which, from 
inspiration at the event, Humanist began. He was then as friendly, 
stalwart and faithful as he remained throughout the following years. 
Solid as a rock, until suddenly he wasn't.

With news of his death various things have been done and others are 
planned. The official online memorial is at 
aurora-22360.tributes.com/show/Charles--Chuck--Bush-91259514. I have 
made desultory effort to collect remembrances of Chuck in addition to 
the brief expressions which flooded the internal ACH Executive list. 
Here are two.

""He was a good man"", Steve Ramsay wrote on 14 April, and like Steve ""I 
will miss his kindly bearing and his good sense.  He will be dearly 
missed.""

Harold sent me ""one general and one specific observation about Chuck"":

> The general one is to do with the way he combined thoughtfulness and
> good humour.  He had a way of blinking that always seemed to me a
> sure sign he was thinking - i.e. he had listened to what you had to
> say and he was reflecting on it, a trait one might wish for in all
> one's colleagues.  So many times in Committee meetings, where I often
> encountered him of course in the last few years, his would be the
> calm voice that suggested it might be a good idea to move our
> discussion in a different direction, or added some significant point
> in support of an argument.
>
> But perhaps his greatest gift was in putting forward his point of
> view or telling you things in indirect or subtle ways.  I remember an
> occasion when I was well on the way to making a very public gaffe
> over confusing Fred Bloggs and Fred Smith; realising this, Chuck did
> not say 'don't be an idiot, you surely mean Fred Bloggs'. What he
> said was: 'we should find a way to involve Fred Smith in our new
> initiative X, don't you think?'  It was very subtly done, but saved
> me both immediate and later public embarrassment.  Not many people
> have that gift!

Simple gifts. Farewell, Chuck. Happy birthday, Humanist.

Yours,
WM

""Electronic philology is not only a way to make things faster and
inventories more accurate. It is not just a tool. It is also, more
deeply, a change in our attitude."" (F.A. Marcos Marin, 1998, in New Media
and the Humanities: Research and Applications ed. D. Fiormonte and J.
Usher, 2001, p.19)

In spite of the attitude we take, whether for historical reasons, or
because the situation demands it, to regard the computer as ""just a
tool"", the fact remains that the addition of the tool to the task always
changes the task. Even the example Willard gave of the mainframe
computer that they all regarded as just a tool because it was kept in a
separate room and didn't much interact with them, changed forever their
methods of working and the sort of things they could do.

The tendency for you to call something ""just a tool"" might be inversely 
proportional to your degree of interaction with it.

Hello Willard and Humanist readers (and ""ponderers"")

Another year as the wheel turns.  Congratulations to you Willard for seeing us through another cycle of the years!  Indeed, 26 is something like ""maturity""---hopefully not creaky old age, of which some of us are too aware; may there by 26 more, and more.  And if we add the UToronto predecessor to Humanist (alas, my fading memory has forgotten the name   :-(    ) Willard deserves credit for more than 26.  And speaking of blogs, twitter, etc. I suppose I show my age, but that is just too much information (some of it pretty random) to digest---either quickly or slowly.  But I show my age in that comment.  Humanist moves ""slowly"" so to speak, but hopefully it moves thoughtfully and reflectively (not that a blog is not thoughtful and reflective also!)

I give less attention to Humanist than I should (I keep a closer focus on some current research/translation projects). But the digital humanities stay on my mind.  And yes, interdisciplinary, or as I have now heard, collaborative research is flourishing in some quarters---but it hard to see what the best model for achieving true collaboration will be.  Surely the possibility of quick, easy and detailed (textual, aural and visual) communication over vast distances is one element that is present now that was absent when Humanist stuck its foot into the flow of electrons.  I'm struck (from a weekly lunch with retired colleagues that includes scientists and one in particular who is still conducting research, how in certain fields (his is chemistry) you have to collaborate with others for reasons of lab equipment, expertise in the nitty gritty or the purely theoretical, etc etc.  I note with great interest (since I seem to be combining theology, spirituality, exegesis and iconography some of my endeavors) that the U. of Chicago has a new program (and building!!) dedicated to collaborative research (with funding!!!) chaired by David Nirenberg (who just spoke at Oberlin on the topic of his newest book).  I also discovered (probably old news to many on this list) that Notre Dame has a Mellon grant for interdisciplinary research/workshops on Literature and Religion, Music and Religion, and other combinations.  Perhaps, to take up Willard's comment near the endof his reflections---we ourselves have to envision and actualize (and encourage) work that brings disciplines together as much as we can in our own work, while drawing other people into the 'mix"" and furthering (and perhaps being a bit activist about it) interdisciplinary conversations.  

Well, enough for now.  I've not posted in at least 26 ""dog years"".  So to close, Happy Birthday Humanist!

best

Dear Willard,

I sincerely doubted sending this in, and at several moments hovered with my
finger above the trash can icon. But I guess Humanist should be the judge
on this. I'm truly sorry but your subject, excerpt, and comment totally
pushed my rant-button. However subjective, this is an account of true
experience with an edge on social structureâ¦ handle with care I guess.

â¦

No, I don't think that boundary is moving at all. Let me explain that by
telling a story. This is not my story. This is a story about a man who is a
builder. He is a builder of software. In the true fashion of computer
science he regards himself as a problem solver. But he is working in a
humanities environment. This makes for some uncomfortable feelings of
mismatch, as it turns out after a while that humanities has no problems to
really solve. Our protagonist finds that humanities studies problems,
offers perspectives, articulates possible meanings, paints a multitude of
critical perceptions. Some arguments seem more valid than others, depending
strongly on context, but all are seemingly valuable. But the harder our
hero looks the fewer concrete problems of the type ""How do we make water
run uphill?"" crop up.

But then he discovers that at the bottom of the scientific building of
humanities, in the trenches where information is gathered, structured, and
offered for higher scrutiny, some problems-one-could-say emerge from
repetitive, mind numbing, error prone, yet highly valuable tasks: churning
out the primitives and primary data that humanities scholars need for their
synthetic analysis. This is the realm of data entry and curation, of
documentary and scholarly editing tasks that prepare the raw data to be
refined through the hands of academic scholars. Here our hero finds a first
application ground for his merit. Here's repetition. Here he can scale.
Here he can help the humanities benefit from computing power.

But the researchers do not quite see the scientific merit of that. If it is

Remembrance of Humanist's past, from 7 May 1987, which I yearly celebrate,
was this time triggered by something older. I was looking into the history
of our discipline and serendipitously came across a chapter by Joseph Raben,
""Content analysis and the study of poetry"", in a book on content analysis,
The Analysis of Communication Content (1969), ed. Gerbner et al. In it Raben
writes as follows:

How widely, I found myself wondering, do we appreciate this form of
reprocity? Ambient technological determinism works against it. The idea of
impact and the billiard-ball theory of history behind that idea impedes it.
Implementation services -- and, of course, the demand to show impact in
scholarly work -- opposes any realization of it with institutional force.

But here we have Joe Raben 46 years ago pointing to the relationship of
reciprocity between the two phenomena named in the title of his journal,
Computers and the Humanities. Experience suggests to me that we still
struggle to realise it. This is so not only because articulating ideas or
forms of research, many of them tacit, is difficult in computational terms.
We struggle also, I suspect, because the cycle of reciprocal exchange
between the two, as Langdon Winner points out in Autonomous Technology
(1977), results in technomorphic humanity as well as anthropomorphic
technology. Scary that. Easier just to lie down and be impacted?

You may be thinking that this is a strange way to begin a birthday message
to Humanist as it enters its 29th year -- even unprecedented, as presenters
on the evening news programmes are fond of saying. But, since Joe was in the
room when the idea of Humanist began, his disturbing words of alert are
especially relevant. Humanist was intended originally to do something about
our situation as then institutional, disciplinary pariahs. Now things are
different, wonderfully so, but aren't they also the same, or nearly so, as
far as Joe's disciplinary reciprocity is concerned? True, the lecture
circuit for digital humanities is an information superhighway (to quote a
quaint phrase), professorships are being advertised, PhDs being granted in
the subject. But how much closer are we to being actively reciprocal in
Raben's sense?

Much of the reciprocity I suspect is hidden (because never published) in
technical practice that surfaces when the demands of research in a
humanities discipline run into the primitive state of the technology. The
great challenge to the latter leads not only to inventions and clever
work-arounds but also to the frustration that could, perhaps sometimes does,
provide a glimpse of a better, a different computing. I wonder if the
anxiety to prove itself valuable to its institutional betters turns digital
humanities aside from such glimpses? Not that they are easy to get. Our
pretty much total lack of the means to describe them stands in the way. I
know, I use loads of words to say that I have none. :-)

Allow me to suggest on this birthday, with Joe's help from long ago, that
what matters is not what scholars know that they want or need but what they
cannot get and mostly don't pause to investigate. Not reasonable hope but
wild, impossible, frustrated desire. Decorously omitted from annual reports
and workload models, of course, but the life-blood of Humanist and other
worthy forums.

Happy Birthday Humanist!

Yours,
WM

        Subject: Happy Birthday Humanist (7 May 1987--)


Humanist begins its 30th year today. As we mark birthdays, this is its 29th
birthday, but as you will see in the following message, some think it's time
to celebrate.

How time passes, if that it what it does, whatever it is. We all know that
different kinds of biological creatures live their lives at different rates,
dogs as I recall at seven times the rate of us humans. Our technological
creatures because of technological progress, metaphorically speaking, live
out their lives at a very fast rate indeed, though not as fast as insects.
Social institutions tend to develop very slowly in relation to ourselves and
to last a very long time. But then we have the liberty of constructing their
continuity in retrospect. We calculate the 'life' of the library in
millennia, for example. So where does this leave Humanist, a mixture of
biologically based activity, technological means and social institution?

Humanist began, as some here will know already, in order to bring a few
people, scattered around the world but mostly in N America and the UK,
together to serve as a common does in a small village and to do this well.
(At the time this meant publishing messages without typos, spelling errors
and messed-up formatting.) It was then almost the only such thing available.
But as other services, e.g. personal blogs and Twitter, have come online its
most important function to my mind, perhaps now more obviously than before,
is to raise and discuss substantive questions about the developing nature of
digital humanities, the epistemology of computing, its social effects and
the like and how these draw on and contribute to the older disciplines.

An example might help here. Recently, commenting on the text of a
lecture I've just finished, an friend of mine wrote back to say,

> on the difficult topic of intuition, Aristotle, usually a stickler

and to a dialogue between us and the philosophers interested in such
matters. What does it mean to take computers on board in the light of
such questions?

The Humanist common remains despite the pull of the older disciplines on
activities with computing that happen to concern them in particular.
Sometimes I wonder if and sometimes am certain that colleagues in those
disciplines (unlike my friend) simply don't see that what concerns them
mutatis mutandis concerns everyone, and that its particular form in this or
that discipline tells us all something important about digital epistemology,
anthropology, sociology or whatever. Will it turn out to be that a small
band of interdisciplinary raiders continues to have far too much work to do
merely in gathering together insights from across the disciplines?

Perhaps I should not, especially on Humanist's birthday, be complaining.
Being such a raider is what I enjoy most. But in the course of an ordinary
life birthdays rather soon become occasions on which the fact of mortality
is hard to avoid. Usually the upcoming 30th marks the end of youth, the
beginning of serious maturity, when people (such as parents) begin to wonder
out loud when you're going to settle down, have children, buy a house, get a
mortgage etc. I think the anti-DH sentiment recently marked here might well
be interpreted as just such a sharp parental question. At least sometimes if
not often this question has the odour of a death-sentence. Personally I
think we should answer it on behalf of Humanist and the field it stands for
by enacting a plan for becoming differently, more interestingly, more
intelligently wild.

Happy birthday to us all!

Yours,
WM

        Subject: Significant event


Dear Willard,

Greetings from Rome via a very flaky internet connection to congratulate you and Humanist on a significant event on 7 May, when the Humanist numbering system will flick over to 30, signifying that Humanist is entering its thirtieth year of operation, moving towards its thirtieth birthday on 7 May 2017. Thirty years of a daily stream of thought-provoking, entertaining, intellectually rigorous, informative and useful postings is an amazing achievement. Humanist has played a fundamental role in the emergence of the digital humanities and has shown how new technologies can enable new disciplinary alignments.

Some of Humanist's admirers have been plotting to mark Humanist's achievement, and we cannot think of a better way of doing so than as part of the U.K. National festival of the humanities, 'Being Human', which takes place this year from 17-25 November 2016. Professor Jane Winters of the School of Advanced Study at the University of London and I will be organising an event during the festival to mark Humanistâs tyhirtieth year of operation, and further details will be given here when the programme for the festival is announced. We will be producing a digital representation of the event, which wil be linked back to material from the Humanist annals, and will be made available on Humanistâs 30th birthday in 2017.

In the meantime, Willard and Humanist, here's a Peroni beer toast to your wonderful achievement.

        From: Willard McCarty 
        Subject: Happy 30th birthday

Dear colleagues,

It is a sign of age in more than one sense, and I would like to think of 
maturity, that this 30th birthday of Humanist almost passed without my 
noticing. I only noticed because the automatic changeover of volume and 
issue to 30.1 caught my eye. It may also be more evidence that reliance 
on automata, for example in my diary reminders of appointments, 
birthdays etc, has gradually offloaded more and more bits of my 
attentiveness. There's the clever app which tells me it's time to go to 
bed in order to get a full 8 hours of sleep, and then wakes me up with 
birdsong. There's the app which times the brushing of teeth. And there 
are many other possibilities to set reminders of this and that, and 
wearable devices to give you a tap on the wrist. A good thing or a bad 
thing, or simply a thing? If attentiveness were like a bank account which 
is depleted by direct debits, then automation would be unambiguously 
depriving us of mental wealth. But it isn't. Is it?

Jessica Riskin's The Restless Clock (2016) tells us that there are 
precedents going back much further than digital machines. She plays with 
the idea of agency, divorcing consciousness from it, to come up with her 
thesis that machines are agents by being unpredictable. (If that's the 
case, then as Herman Goldstine and John von Neumann argued in 1947, the 
stored-program computer has been an agent from the get-go.) 
Interestingly she discusses the holy and unholy machines of the late 
medieval and early modern periods, arguing that their agency, as far as 
the pious were concerned, materialised for their time, for them, the 
beings their automata (shifting metaphysical gears) represented. We can 
do the same with ours for our time? 

After 30 years, now beginning the 31st, with popularity a major problem, 
with academic appointments secured, postdocs too, PhD degrees on offer, 
in progress and achieved, the dream conceived in protest in Columbia, 
South Carolina, in 1987, with Michael Sperberg-McQueen and others in a 
group of disgruntled outsiders, has to be redreamt. It seems to me that 
what's been achieved or simply come about for us to celebrate is not 
demolition of what once seemed an unbreachable stone wall but the 
opportunity to do unexpected and interesting things. Disciplines, I like 
to say and do believe, are starting points, not -- except for those 
whose ambitions go no further -- points of arrival or clubs to be 
joined. I come back to the closing sentences in Geoffrey Lloyd's The 
Ambitions of Curiosity: Understanding the World in Ancient Greece and 
China (2002) -- read it tonight!

> Both societies, I have suggested, developed basic human capacities
> for curiosity in intriguing and ingenious ways. But in both, the
> ambitions of curiosity were just that, just ambitions. But what
> ambitions: for in one context after another, they held out the hope
> of understanding what had never been understood before.

If we can understand this for ourselves and our own amorphous society -- 
that we hold out such hope -- then I think we have cause to celebrate 
this Sunday morning birthday.

Yours,
WM

Hello Charles,

You might be interested in the Catalogue of Digital Editions:
https://dig-ed-cat.eos.arz.oeaw.ac.at/

While this does not lay out the information regarding critical edition
exactly as you may be looking for - you can browse projects that are hosted
on various digital edition platforms.

There's also the DIRT directory: https://dirtdirectory.org/

This may contain more relevant information to your search for specific
platforms/tools and their pros and cons.

Best regards,

        Subject: ""Culture & Technology"" - 9th European Summer University in Digital Humanities 17th to 27th July 2018 Leipzig - new deadline


""CULTURE & TECHNOLOGY"" - 
9TH EUROPEAN SUMMER UNIVERSITY 
IN DIGITAL HUMANITIES (ESU DH C & T) - 
17TH TO 27TH JULY 2018, 
UNIVERSITY OF LEIPZIG 
HTTP://WWW.CULINGTEC.UNI-LEIPZIG.DE/ESU_C_T/

Although we have received more than enough applications we have decided 
to extend the application phase to the 20th of May 2018 in order to give 
those people a chance who could not manage to upload their application 
before the deadline (see: 
http://www.culingtec.uni-leipzig.de/ESU_C_T/node/915).

Not all the workshops can, however, take more applications (see 
http://www.culingtec.uni-leipzig.de/ESU_C_T/node/921). Only in the 
following workshops there is still a small number of places available 
(please note that workshops run in parallel: 
http://www.culingtec.uni-leipzig.de/ESU_C_T/node/953):

     Carol Chiodo (Yale University, USA) / Lauren Tilton (University of 
Richmond, USA): Hands on Humanities Data Workshop - Creation, Discovery 
and Analysis (2 weeks)
     Isabel Fuhrmann (Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften 
Berlin, Germany) / Erhard Hinrichs / Yana Strakatova (UniversitÃ¤t 
TÃ¼bingen, Germany): Collocations from a multilingual perspective: 
theory, tools, and applications (1st week)
     Nils Reiter / Sarah Schulz (UniversitÃ¤t Stuttgart, Germany): 
Reflected Text Analysis in the Digital Humanities (2nd week)
     David Joseph Wrisley (New York University Abu Dhabi, UAE) / Randa El 
Khatib (University of Victoria, Canada): Humanities Data and Mapping 
Environments (2 weeks)
     Laszlo Hunyadi / IstvÃ¡n SzekrÃ©nyes (University of Debrecen, 
Hungary): Building and analysing multimodal corpora (2 weeks)
     Maciej Eder (Polish Academy of Sciences / Pedagogical University, 
Cracow, Poland) / Jeremi Ochab (Jagiellonian University, Cracow, 
Poland): Stylometry (2 weeks)
     Christoph Draxler (UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nchen, Germany) / Thorsten Trippel 
(Eberhard-Karls UniversitÃ¤t TÃ¼bingen, Germany): Asking questions to data 
in the humanities: right, correct, efficient (Introducing and comparing 
XQuery, SQL, SPARQL for data from the humanities) (2 weeks)
     Peter Bell (Heidelberg Academy of Science and Humanities, Germany) / 
Leonardo Impett (Ãcole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne, Switzerland): 
Computer Vision Intervention. How digital methods help to visually 
understand corpora of art and cultural heritage (1st week)
     Nicola Carboni (Harvard Institut ""Villa I Tatti"", Firenze, Italy) / 
Leo Zorc (UniversitÃ¤t ZÃ¼rich / ETH ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland): Integrating 
Human Science Data using CIDOC-CRM as Formal Ontology: a practical 
approach (2nd week)
     Tommi A Pirinen (UniversitÃ¤t Hamburg, Germany): The humanities 
scholar's perspective on rule based machine translation (2 weeks)
     Jochen Tiepmar (ScaDS, University of Leipzig / University of 
Dresden, Germany): Text Mining with Canonical Text Services (2nd week)
     Heike Neuroth / Ulrike Wuttke (University of Applied Sciences 
Potsdam): How Research Infrastructures empower eHumanities and eHeritage 
Research(ers) (1st week)
     Lynne Siemens (University of Victoria, Canada): Introduction to 
Project Management (2nd week)

Workshops are structured in such a way that participants can either take 
the two blocks of one workshop or two blocks from different workshops. 
The number of participants in each workshop is limited to 10.

We can also *not* take more applications for CLARIN-D and ETCL 
fellowships. We received about three times more applications than the 
number of fellowships available.

The Summer University takes place across 11 whole days. The intensive 
programme consists of workshops, public lectures, regular project 
presentations, a poster session, teaser sessions and a panel discussion.

The Summer University is directed at 60 participants from all over 
Europe and beyond. It wants to bring together (doctoral) students, young 
scholars and academics from the Arts and Humanities, Library Sciences, 
Social Sciences, the Arts and Engineering and Computer Sciences as equal 
partners to an interdisciplinary exchange of knowledge and experience in 
a multilingual and multicultural context and thus create the conditions 
for future project-based cooperations.

The Leipzig Summer University is special because it not only seeks to 
offer a space for the discussion and acquisition of new knowledge, 
skills and competences in those computer technologies which play a 
central role in Humanities Computing and which determine every day more 
and more the work done in the Humanities and Cultural Sciences, as well 
as in publishing, libraries, and archives etc., but because it tries to 
integrate also linguistics with the Digital Humanities, which pose 
questions about the consequences and implications of the application of 
computational methods and tools to cultural artefacts of all kinds.

It is special furthermore because it consciously aims at confronting the 
so-called Gender Divide , i.e. the under-representation of women in the 
domain of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Germany, 
Europe and many parts of the world, by relying on the challenges that 
the Humanities with their complex data and their wealth of women 
represent for Computer Science and Engineering and the further 
development of the latter, on the overcoming of the boarders between the 
so-called hard and soft sciences and on the integration of Humanities, 
Computer Science and Engineering.

As the Summer University is dedicated not only to the acquisition of 
knowledge and skills, but also wants to foster community building and 
networking across disciplines, languages and cultures, countries and 
continents, the programme of the Summer School features also communal 
coffee breaks, communal lunches in the refectory of the university, and 
a rich cultural programme (thematic guided tours, visits of archives, 
museums and exhibitions, and communal dinners in different parts of 
Leipzig).

For all relevant information please consult the Web-Portal of the 
European Summer School in Digital Humanities ""Culture & Technology"": 
http://www.culingtec.uni-leipzig.de/ESU_C_T/ which will be continually 
updated and integrated with more information as soon as it becomes 
available.

If you have questions with respect to the European Summer University 
please direct them to esu_ct@uni-leipzig.de

ESU DH C & T is a member of the International Digital Humanities 
Training Network.
