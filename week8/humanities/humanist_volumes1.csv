This is a test of a new BITNET mailer for people involved with the
support of computing in the humanities. Please acknowledge receipt of
this message. A more complete explanation and welcoming message will be
forthcoming.
Thanks very much.

Bill Winder wants to compile Gnu C++ on a PC under a *NIX* OS. He could,

problems.

Gnu C could be adapted for any machine code set in theory. It really depends
on how much time you have, and how well you understand your chip.

And yet we still communicate fairly effectively.

Occasionally, though, I notice lette"
